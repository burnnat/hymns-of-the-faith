Lord, You are my life, my rock and solid ground.
    [Lord, You are my life, the ground on which I stand.]
Lord, You are my way, the truth that leads me on.
Always will I follow, long as I shall breathe,
    [Always will I follow, guided by Your Word.]
    [Guided by Your Word, a lamp unto my feet,]
guided by your holy Word, ever may I be!
    [with your holy Word my path, ever may it be!]
Nothing will I fear while You are by my side;
stay with me, my Comfort and Guide.

Jesus, born of Mary, I believe in You:
Son of God Eternal, full of grace and truth. # John 1:14
    [Son of God Eternal, fully human too.]
You who rose to life, in love for us had died.
    [You who rose again, and for our sake had died,]
    [You who died for love, now living with us still]
    [You who died for love, now lives among us still]
One with God the Father and with the church Your bride,
soon the day is coming when You'll come again;
bring us home to live with You then!
    [final reign of God without end!]
    [... your everlasting reign then!]
    [Bring about your reign on earth then!]

Lord, You are my strength, my fortress and my shield.
    [my one and only hope]
    [desire of my heart]
    [light, sun, shield, ...]
Lord, You are my peace, my freedom from all fear.
Nothing in this world can separate us, Lord;
By Your hand, I know my salvation is assured!
    [In Your hands I know that my safety is assured!]
Spare me from all evil, cure my sinful ways;
    [Spare me from all evil, cleanse me of my sin;]
May I live in mercy and grace!
    [...living in forgiveness and grace.]
    [in this holy mercy, I live]

Father of creation, I believe in You.
Jesus, dearest savior, still I hope in You.
Dwell among us, Spirit, source of strength and joy.
    [...strength and love]
    [...love and joy]
From a thousand nations you called us by Your voice;
    [You who from a thousand lands called us by Your voice,]
Send us then unto a thousand lands beyond,
    [Scatter us across a thousand more beyond,]
Seedlings of the kingdom of God.
