Text: {{person "Edmond Louis Budry"}} (1854–1932), 1904
 - Many believe this text to be written as a response to the death of his first wife
 - Translated into English from French by {{person "Richard Hoyle"}} in 1925

Tune: {{person "George Frideric Handel"}} (1689–1759), 1747
 - Born in Germany, son a prominent barber-surgeon who wanted him to study law
 - In a chance encounter, his natural talent on the keyboard drew the attention of Duke Johann Adolf I
 - At the duke's insistence, studied music under the cathedral organist of Halle, his hometown
 - Emigrated to England in 1713 after traveling internationally for some time (including a period of study in Italy)
 - Best-known for his oratorios and Italian operas (especially the "Messiah"), among other baroque instrumental works
 - The tune is named {{caps "Judas Maccabeus"}} after the oratorio it was taken from, with the lyrics "See the conquering hero comes..."
 - Actually, Handel originally wrote the chorus for his oratorio "Joshua" but moved it to "Judas Maccabeus" a few years later
 - First use as a hymn tune dates back to 1760 at least, where the {{book "Harmonia Sacra"}} paired it with {{person "Charles Wesley"}}'s "Christ the Lord is Risen Today"
 - {{person "John Wesley"}} names it in his journal as one of his favorite tunes
