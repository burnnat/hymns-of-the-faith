## Rhyme
 - Although many would name rhyme as a key quality of poetry, rhyme is a comparatively recent invention
	 - Classical poetry in ancient Greece relied purely on meter with "long" and "short" syllables, rather than stressed syllables used for English
	 - Hebrew poetry in the psalms often use acrostics for organization and memory aid
	 - Early English poetry too (in Anglo-Saxon and Middle English) focused on alliteration rather than rhyme
	 - Only comparatively recently (late middle ages, early renaissance) did rhyme rise to prominence
 - Today we recognize many different types of rhyme:
	- "true"/"pure"/"perfect" rhyme: "cat" and "hat"
	- "slant"/"false"/"imperfect" rhyme: "soul" and "all"
	- "sight"/"eye" rhyme: "love" and "prove"
	- assonance: "flesh" and "head"
 - Many people decry the loss of pure rhymes in modern music:
	> If [Watts, Wesley, and Crosby] could churn out thousands upon thousands of perfectly rhymed hymns, surely a gifted contemporary writer can get through at least a few original contributions without having to fall back on assonance.

	- In reality, many of the great hymnwriters (especially Watts!) used their share of slant rhymes and sight rhymes.

## {{{hymn "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing" id="come_thou_fount_of_every_blessing"}}}

Text: Robert Robinson (1735–1790), 1757
 - Born into a poor English family, father died early in his childhood
 - With his widowed mother unable to provide for the family, went to London as a barber's apprentice
 - After hearing George Whitefield's preaching, found "peace by believing" at age 20
 - Served as pastor in a disparate collection of churches: Calvinistic Methodist, Congregationalist, and Baptist
 - Finally after retirement in 1790, found himself leaning towards Unitarianism
 - Better known for his works of prose (particularly regarding baptism) than for his thirteen hymns
 - This text was written for Pentecost Sunday at the Calvinistic Methodist chapel in Mildenhall
 - Most hymnals combined the original verses 2 and 3 and omit the final verse

Tune: Traditional American, 1813
 - First published anonymously in a set of folk hymn tunes published by John Wyeth in 1813
 - Not a musician, Wyeth worked with Methodist preacher Elkanah Kelsay Dare to publish his tunebook for use in Methodist and Baptist camp meetings
 - Named {{{caps "Nettleton"}}} after 19th-century evangelist Ahasel Nettleton
 - Some hymnals name Nettleton as the tune's author, since it was included in his {{{book "Village Hymns"}}} of 1824
 - However, no evidence exists that Nettleton ever wrote any hymn tunes himself

1.

2. Look at the use of rhyme in the text, both true rhyme and slant rhymes. Does the inclusion of "false" rhymes hurt the text at all? Also consider the original text compared to its "modern" version - why do you think sections of verses 2, 3, and 5 are routinely omitted?
	- The slant rhymes appear at the beginning rather than end of verses (with the possible exception of "God"/"blood")
		- This maintains the feeling of "closure" given by true rhymes
