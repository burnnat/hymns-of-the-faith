## {{{hymn "Christ Be Beside Me" id="christ_be_beside_me"}}}

Text: {{person "Saint Patrick" name="Patrick"}} (387–461), ca. 430
 - Born in Britain in the Roman Empire, captured by Irish raiders at 16 and taken to Ireland as a slave
 - In captivity, worked as a shepherd and with prayer and meditation converted to Christianity
 - After six years, escaped from his master and sailed home where he became a Catholic priest
 - Prompted by a vision several years after, returned to Ireland as a Christian missionary
 - Later appointed a bishop, with few details about his work surviving outside of legends and tradition
 - Original text was a lorica (prayer for protection, literally translated "breastplate" from Latin) leading to its common title of "St. Patrick's Breastplate"
 - Earliest appearance is in Old Irish from the 9th century Book of Armagh and gives its name as "Fáeth Fiada" (meaning "Deer's Cry")

Tune: {{person "Traditional Gaelic" name="Traditional"}}, 1888
 - First recorded by Mary Macdonald, a Gaelic-speaking hymnwriter who used it for her Christmas hymn "Leanabh an àigh" ("Child of Joy")
 - Published in {{book "Songs and Hymns of the Gael"}} by Lachlan Macbean, who translated the hymn into English
 - Macbean assigned the name {{caps "Bunessan"}}, after the closest village to where Macdonald lived in the Ross of Mull, an island west of the Scottish highlands
 - When {{person "Percy Dearmer"}} and {{person "Ralph Vaughan Williams"}} heard the tune, they commissioned a new text "Morning Has Broken" from {{person "Eleanor Farjeon"}} to accompany it
