 1. This hymn gets much of its power through the use of contrasts, which its original subtitle "Light shining out of darkness" alludes to. What examples of this do you see in the text? Which metaphors do you find most effective?
{{#if notes}}
	- Contrasts:
		- Stanza 2: Deep mines vs. bright treasures
		- Stanza 4: Frowning providence vs. smiling face
		- Stanza 5: Bitter bud vs. sweet flower
	- Other metaphors:
		- Stanza 3: Life's fears are like a cloud that parts into sunshine of blessings
		- Stanza 5: God's purposes ripen like a fruit
		- Stanza 6: Unbelief is "literally" blind, unable to read God's promises correctly

2. William Cowper is closely associated with John Newton, whose most famous hymn is undoubtedly "Amazing Grace". Do you see any similarities between these two hymns, in either style or content? How do they differ from one another?
{{#if notes}}
	- The topics are a bit different, but the styles are much the same
		- Both hymns use a fairly simple vocabulary
		- Both use contrasts to good effect ("once was lost but now am found / was blind but now I see")
	- Cowper is rather more extensive in his metaphors than Newton
