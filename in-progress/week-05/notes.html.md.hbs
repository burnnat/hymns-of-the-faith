2. The final words "thy new, best name of Love" recalls another text of Wesley's, "Come O Thou Traveler Unknown" (titled "Wrestling Jacob", also written in 1742). Read the poem aloud as a class. Do you see other parallels between the two?

2. Though it occasianlly appears with other tunes, Darwall's is an overwhelming favorite for use with this hymn. What feature can you see in the music that make it such a good fit?
