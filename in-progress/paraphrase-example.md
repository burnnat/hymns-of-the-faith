Lord, you lead to fields of green
and crystal waters fresh;
here I find my soul restored,
and for my body, rest.

From Your cooling streams I'll drink,
and in Your pasture feed.
Nothing more do I require;
Your flock has all I need.

Dare I enter death's dark path,
where none but brave souls trod?
Yes! For You are with me still,
my Guidance, Shepherd God.

Hidden comfort, quiet calm,
Your workings are to me,
present peace, and future hope,
poured out abundantly.

Far I run and hide myself
in leaves of fear and shame;
farther still You seek me out,
for furth'rance of Your name.

Chased by goodness, caught by grace,
however far I flee,
always shall I dwell with You
and always You with me.
