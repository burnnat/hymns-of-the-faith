<p>Text: <span id="charles_wesley">Charles Wesley</a> (1707–1788), 1738</p>
<ul>
<li>After a disastrous trip to the colony of Georgia as missionaries, the Wesley brothers were impressed by the faith of a group of Moravians on their ship back to England</li>
<li>This prompted them to attend a meeting on Aldersgate Street, London, where the Moravian <span id="peter_bohler">Peter Bohler</a> was speaking and brought about a renewal of the Wesleys’ faith</li>
<li>Wesley wrote this text shortly after his re-conversion; the mention in his journal that “I began a hymn upon my conversion” leads many to believe this is the hymn Wesley is referring to</li>
<li>When first published in 1739, it was given the subtitle “Free Grace”</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="thomas_campbell">Thomas Campbell</a> (1777–1844), 1825</p>
<ul>
<li>Very little is known about Campbell’s life in England</li>
<li>Few of his poems and hymn tunes are in use today</li>
<li>This tune is taken from a collection of tunes titled <cite class="book">The Bouquet</cite>, each given a flower-related name</li>
<li>The name <cite class="tune">Sagina</cite> is a family of flowers related to carnations, commonly called “pearlwort”</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Appropriately, as a “conversion hymn” the text centers around the concept of salvation. What ideas does Wesley show in his text that makes this grace so “amazing”?</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="before_thy_throne_o_god_we_kneel_give_us" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/before_thy_throne_o_god_we_kneel_give_us">Before Thy Throne, O God, We Kneel</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="william_boyd_carpenter">William Boyd Carpenter</a> (1841–1918), 1925</p>
<ul>
<li>Son of an Anglican minister in Liverpool (with Carpenter his father’s family name, and Boyd his mother’s)</li>
<li>Served at a variety of churches, eventually appointed Bishop of Ripon in 1884</li>
<li>Many of his writings focus on personal and experiences of faith, rather than abstract theology</li>
<li>Granted an honorary Doctor of Divinity from the University of Glasgow, also lectured at Cambridge, Oxford, and Harvard universities</li>
<li>Chaplain to Queen Victoria, this led to a correspondence with her granddaughter Alexandra Feodorovna, the last empress of Russia, on her adjustment to the Russian Orthodox church</li>
<li>Between two wives, Carpenter fathered 11 children (5 boys and 6 girls), and among his grandchildren include a member of parliament as well as prominent academics, lawyers, and businessmen</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="dmitri_bortnianski">Dmitri Bortnianski</a> (1751–1825), 1822</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in modern-day Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire), joined the Russian imperial chapel choir at the age of eight years old</li>
<li>The chapel choir director Baldassare Galuppi returned to Italy in 1769 and Bortnianski followed, studying in Venice, Rome, and Naples</li>
<li>After 10 years abroad, returned to Russia and in 1796 became the choir’s first Russian-born director</li>
<li>In addition to sacred music, he wrote seven operas and other concert pieces</li>
<li>The tune <cite class="tune">St. Petersburg</cite> is named for the city where he lived and worked</li>
<li>His music later influenced famous Russian composers Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff</li>
<li>Tchaikovsky edited and published much of Bortnianski’s church music in 1882, totaling 10 volumes</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Both “And Can It Be” and “Before Thy Throne” deal with the concept of freedom from sin, but with somewhat different perspectives. What similarities and differences do you see between the two hymns on this topic?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the hymn “Imperfect Child of Perfect God”, whose theme is similar to both “And Can It Be” and “Before Thy Throne”. List places that you think work well, and places that need improvement. What changes would you suggest? Consider the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Meter and rhyme</li>
<li>Word choice and imagery</li>
<li>Scripture references</li>
<li>Flow of ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
