<p>Text: <span id="henry_francis_lyte">Henry Francis Lyte</a> (1793–1847), 1834</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in Scotland, his father abandoned the family and mother died while he was at boarding school</li>
<li>Became an Anglican curate at age 21, but only afterward experienced a radical conversion that invigorated his ministry</li>
<li>Began serving a church in Brixham on the south coast of England in 1824</li>
<li>Despite facing ill health for most of his life, he remained in ministry there for over two decades</li>
<li>This text is loosely based on Psalm 103, and included in Lyte’s 1834 collection <cite class="book">Spirit of the Psalms</cite></li>
<li>In 1847, tuberculosis forced him to retire, eventually dying in France only a few months later</li>
<li>Lyte is also known for another famous hymn text, “Abide With Me”, written near the end of his life</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="john_goss">John Goss</a> (1800–1880), 1868</p>
<ul>
<li>Son of an organist in Hampshire, England, moved to London at age 11 to live with his uncle, a choir member for St. Paul’s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey</li>
<li>Received a strict musical education as a chorister for the Chapel Royal under <span id="john_stafford_smith">John Stafford Smith</a> (whose tune “To Anacreon in Heaven” would later be used for “The Star-Spangled Banner”)</li>
<li>In 1816, began organ study with <span id="thomas_attwood">Thomas Attwood</a>, organist at St. Paul’s, himself a former student of Mozart and friend of Felix Mendelssohn</li>
<li>Goss later succeeded Attwood at St. Paul’s, also teaching harmony at the Royal Academy of Music (with a young <span id="arthur_sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> one of his students)</li>
<li>The tune <cite class="tune">Lauda Anima</cite>, named for the opening of Psalm 103 in Latin, was written specifically for use with Lyte’s text, with individual harmonizations to accompany each stanza</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Consider the way this hymn portrays the relationship between God and humans. What qualities are ascribed to God? What about us, his people? How does this help answer the question “why should we praise God?”.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="christ_the_lord_is_risen_today_wesley" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/christ_the_lord_is_risen_today_wesley">Christ the Lord is Risen Today</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="charles_wesley">Charles Wesley</a> (1707–1788), 1739</p>
<ul>
<li>Written roughly a year after Wesley’s conversion at Aldersgate, with the subtitle “Hymn for Easter”</li>
<li>Wesley’s original text did not include any “alleluias”, these were added later to fit the tune when Martin Madan put the two together in his <cite class="book">Psalms and Hymns</cite> in 1760</li>
<li>Interestingly, <span id="john_wesley">John Wesley</a> did not include the hymn in his 1780 <cite class="book">Wesleyan Hymn Book</cite> although it was already in several other Anglican collections at that time</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="anonymous">Anonymous</a>, 1708</p>
<ul>
<li>First appeared in <span id="john_walsh">John Walsh</a>’s collection of hymn tunes titled <cite class="book">Lyra Davidica</cite></li>
<li>The original text was a translation of the Latin hymn “Surrexit Christus hodie” with the similar first line, “Jesus Christ is risen today”</li>
<li>Major revisions to the tune were made in <span id="john_arnold">John Arnold</a>’s <cite class="book">Compleat Psalmodist</cite> in 1749, which is the version mainly used today</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>“Christ the Lord” is also a hymn of praise, but with a particular focus on Easter. In what ways is the text similar to “Praise My Soul”, and in what ways is it different?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
