<p>Text: <span id="anonymous">Anonymous</a>, 1787</p>
<ul>
<li>Published in <cite class="book">A Selection of Hymns from the Best Authors, Intended As an Appendix to Dr. Watts’s Psalms and Hymns</cite> by <span id="john_rippon">John Rippon</a>, with the author only indicated as “K–”</li>
<li>Most scholars believe this refers to <span id="richard_keen">Richard Keen</a>, music director in the London church where Rippon was pastor</li>
<li>The hymn was almost instantly popular, especially in America where it was re-published just three years later</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="anonymous">Anonymous</a>, 1832</p>
<ul>
<li>First included in <cite class="book">A Compilation of Genuine Church Music</cite> by <span id="joseph_funk">Joseph Funk</a> and later in <cite class="book">Southern Harmony</cite> and <cite class="book">The Sacred Harp</cite></li>
<li>Funk was born in Lancaster County, PA, into a German Mennonite family that moved to the Shenandoah Valley, VA, soon after</li>
<li>Working as both a farmer and schoolteacher, Funk published music collections on the side and his <cite class="book">Compilation</cite> is in its 24th revision and still in use by Mennonites today</li>
<li>Although originally listed as <cite class="tune">Protection</cite>, then <cite class="tune">Sincerity</cite> and <cite class="tune">Solicitude</cite>, the tune is now known as <cite class="tune">Foundation</cite></li>
<li>Also sometimes sung to <cite class="tune">Adeste Fideles</cite> (tune for “O Come All Ye Faithful”)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fittingly for a hymn about scripture, the text quotes a number of bible verses off the bat, including <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2041%3A10">Isaiah 41:10</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2043%3A2">Isaiah 43:2</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2031%3A6">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013%3A5">Hebrews 13:5</a>. How closely does the hymn text follow these passages?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What rhetorical devices do you see used in the text that help keep it strong and memorable?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a class, brainstorm potential topics to use in writing a hymn together. Consider the following questions to generate ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What advice would you give to a new Christian, from experience in your own faith journey?</li>
<li>What unique challenges does the church face today (both locally and globally)?</li>
<li>What lessons or ideas do you think are often underappreciated by other Christians?</li>
<li>What occasions or themes does the church currently lack quality music for?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
