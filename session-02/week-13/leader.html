<p>Text: <span id="charles_wesley">Charles Wesley</a> (1707–1788), 1740</p>
<ul>
<li>Originally the fourth part of a six-part poem “The Communion of Saints”</li>
<li>This epic poem totaled 39 stanzas of eight lines each, equivalent to 78 stanzas of common meter</li>
<li>Published in the second edition of the Wesleys’ <cite class="book">Hymns and Sacred Poems</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="orlando_gibbons">Orlando Gibbons</a> (1583–1625), 1623</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in Oxford, England, son of a wait (town piper employed by the local government)</li>
<li>Appointed senior organist at the Chapel Royal by King James I, later at Westminster Abbey</li>
<li>Also played keyboards in the court of King Charles I (Prince Charles at the time)</li>
<li>Died suddenly at age 41, leading to rumors he died of the black plague (autopsy revealed this to be untrue)</li>
<li>Considered one of the finest composers of his generation, best known for his keyboard works</li>
<li>Composed this tune for a text from the Song of Songs, published as the thirteenth hymn in <cite class="book">Hymnes and Songs of the Church</cite> by <span id="george_withers">George Withers</a>, leading to its common name of <cite class="tune">Song 13</cite></li>
<li>Some hymnals refer to the tune by the name <cite class="tune">Canterbury</cite> instead, the place of Gibbons’ death and burial</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wesley is known for (among other things) the scriptural content of his hymns. This hymn also quotes some non-biblical sources as well. What references can you find?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012">1 Corinthians 12</a> talks about spiritual gifts and one-body-many-members</li>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204">Ephesians 4</a> talks about unity (“one Lord, one faith, one baptism”)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A27-28">Galatians 3:27-28</a> talks about ending divisions (“there is neither Jew nor Greek” …)</li>
<li>Opening line comes from Thomas Ken’s “All Praise to Thee, My God, This Night”, which gave us our doxology</li>
<li>Final three lines of the opening match portions of the <cite class="book">Book of Common Prayer</cite></li>
<li>Final verse paraphrases a poem by Matthew Prior, <cite class="book">Solomon</cite>, saying:
<blockquote>
<p>Or grant Thy passion has these names destroy’d<br>
that Love, like Death, makes all distinctions void.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What unique features of this hymn make it memorable and meaningful? How well are these techniques executed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Literary devices:
<ul>
<li>Epanalepsis: “Join us, in one spirit, join”</li>
<li>Repetition: The “all in all” is used first for the completeness of Christ’s fulfillment, then as a title for God</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the first line, “perfecting” has syllables mismatched with the “natural” flow of the tune</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use the thoughts and ideas from last week to write a first verse focusing on church unity at the “world-wide” scale. Use CMD (8.6.8.6D) and this opening line as a starting point: “O Christian church across the globe…”</li>
</ol>
