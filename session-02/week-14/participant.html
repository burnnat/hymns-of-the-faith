		<h2><a id="jesus_united_by_thy_grace" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/jesus_united_by_thy_grace">Jesus, United by Thy Grace</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="charles_wesley">Charles Wesley</a> (1707–1788), 1742</p>
<ul>
<li>Published in the Wesleys’ <cite class="book">Hymns and Sacred Poems</cite> under the title “A Prayer for Persons join’d in Fellowship”</li>
<li>Originally had the opening line “Jesu, united by thy grace” rather than the modern “Jesus”</li>
<li>Most hymnals include only the first six verses of the original nine</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="john_bacchus_dykes">John Bacchus Dykes</a> (1823–1876), 1866</p>
<ul>
<li>Originally written to accompany a different Wesley text, “Jesus, the very thought of Thee”</li>
<li>Named after the Christian martyr <cite class="tune">St. Agnes</cite> who was killed after refusing to marry a local Roman nobleman, saying “I am already engaged to Christ, to Him alone I keep my troth.”</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a “prayer for persons joined in fellowship”, what ideas do you find in the text that still apply more than 250 years later? What suggestions does the hymn give as to how we can go about achieving church unity and community?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poetically, what features or images of this hymn stand out as unique?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Continue with writing a second hymn verse, focusing on local church community and fostering deep, rather than surface-level, relationships. Start with this line: “O Christian neighbors, siblings, friends…”</li>
</ol>
