		<p>O Christian church across the globe,<br>
who in God’s word unite,<br>
although from lands so far away<br>
still glimpse His guiding light,<br>
whom Christ has taken as His bride,<br>
all nations to give praise;<br>
in all the ways you serve the Lord<br>
join all your hands to raise.</p>
<p>…<br>
in unity abide;<br>
may love and joy within our hearts<br>
put all our sins aside.</p>
<p>…<br>
who in God’s word unite,<br>
although from lands so far away<br>
yet still can see Your light,</p>
<p>…<br>
whom God has blessed as sage,<br>
the Bride of Christ, his very own,<br>
all sexes, race, and age</p>
<p>…<br>
make unity your aim;<br>
although you may not think alike,<br>
still love alike the same.</p>
<p>…<br>
let us all come to Christ;<br>
be one in mind and heart and soul,<br>
and ever seek His trust.</p>
<p>…<br>
all nations to give praise;<br>
in all the ways we praise the Lord<br>
give all our hands to raise.</p>
