<p>Tune: <span id="william_henry_havergal">William Henry Havergal</a> (1823–1876), 1847</p>
<ul>
<li>British pastor, educated at Oxford</li>
<li>Served in a number of churches in rural England</li>
<li>Most of his 100+ hymns were written for special occasions and services in his churches</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The original fourth verse, omitted in the United Methodist Hymnal, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Closer and closer, let us cleave<br>
to his belov’d embrace;<br>
expect his fullness to receive,<br>
and grace to answer grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you interpret this phrase “grace to answer grace”? Does this stanza fit with the rest of the hymn, or were the editors right to exclude it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write a third hymn verse about individual growth as a Christian. Earlier brainstorms mentioned learning patience, listening for God’s direction, and focusing on giving to the church rather than on what you “get” from it. Start with this line: “O Christian seeker, child of God…”</li>
</ol>
