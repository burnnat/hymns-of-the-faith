		<h1 class="title">Week 4: Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing</h1>
	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>Text: Robert Robinson, 1757</p>
<p>Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,<br>
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;<br>
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,<br>
Call for songs of loudest praise.<br>
Teach me some melodious sonnet,<br>
Sung by flaming tongues above.<br>
Praise the mount, I’m fixed upon it,<br>
Mount of Thy redeeming love.</p>
<p>Sorrowing I shall be in spirit,<br>
Till released from flesh and sin,<br>
Yet from what I do inherit,<br>
Here Thy praises I’ll begin;<br>
Here I raise my Ebenezer;<br>
Here by Thy great help I’ve come;<br>
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,<br>
Safely to arrive at home</p>
<p>Jesus sought me when a stranger,<br>
Wandering from the fold of God;<br>
He, to rescue me from danger,<br>
Interposed His precious blood;<br>
How His kindness yet pursues me<br>
Mortal tongue can never tell,<br>
Clothed in flesh, till death shall loose me<br>
I cannot proclaim it well.</p>
<p>O to grace how great a debtor<br>
Daily I’m constrained to be!<br>
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,<br>
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.<br>
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,<br>
Prone to leave the God I love;<br>
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,<br>
Seal it for Thy courts above.</p>
<p>O that day when freed from sinning,<br>
I shall see Thy lovely face;<br>
Clothèd then in blood washed linen<br>
How I’ll sing Thy sovereign grace;<br>
Come, my Lord, no longer tarry,<br>
Take my ransomed soul away;<br>
Send thine angels now to carry<br>
Me to realms of endless day.</p>
