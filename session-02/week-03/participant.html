<p>Text: <span id="martin_rinkart">Martin Rinkart</a> (1586–1649), 1636</p>
<ul>
<li>Son of a German tradesman, chorister in Leipzig’s St. Thomas Church as a child</li>
<li>Received a scholarship to study theology at the University of Leipzig</li>
<li>Passed over for a clerical appointment to his hometown, found work elsewhere as a teacher and minister</li>
<li>Finally invited back to serve in his hometown, Eilenburg, by its town council in 1617</li>
<li>Onset of the Thirty Years War soon after inundated the walled city of Eilenburg with displaced refugees</li>
<li>With them was brought famine and plague, with Rinkart often performing between 40-50 funerals in a day</li>
<li>For a time the only clergy in Eilenburg, the combination of his charity and writing soon wore him out</li>
<li>Rinkart’s text “Nun danket alle Gott” was written right in the middle of the war</li>
<li>Translated into English by <span id="catherine_winkworth">Catherine Winkworth</a> (also known for “Praise to the Lord, the Almighty”, among others)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="johann_crüger">Johann Crüger</a> (1598–1662), 1647</p>
<ul>
<li>Born near Brandenburg, Germany, left home to study both music and theology</li>
<li>From 1622 to his death, worked simultaneously as a teacher and cantor (choirmaster) in Berlin</li>
<li>In 1636, lost his wife and several children to the plague, almost dying himself</li>
<li>Remarried shortly thereafter and went on to have fourteen more children</li>
<li>Edited and published <cite class="book">Praxis pietatis melica</cite> in 1647, the most widespread Lutheran hymnal of the 17th century</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It’s interesting to think that this hymn most often associated with times of plenty has its roots in war and famine. What lessons can we learn from the text about how to give thanks in bad times as well as good times?</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="the_church_of_christ_in_every_age" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/the_church_of_christ_in_every_age">The Church of Christ in Every Age</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="fred_pratt_green">Fred Pratt Green</a> (1903–2000), 1969</p>
<ul>
<li>His father was a preacher but resigned over theological disagreements</li>
<li>First worked in his father’s leather business, but felt drawn to ministry</li>
<li>Ordained in the British Methodist church in 1928, serving across England for 40 years</li>
<li>Also wrote poetry and plays in addition to hymn texts and translations</li>
<li>Most prolific period followed, between retirement in 1969 and his last hymn in 1988</li>
<li>Writing focuses on topics and social issues not covered by traditional hymns</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="william_knapp">William Knapp</a> (1698–1768), 1738</p>
<ul>
<li>Very little is known about his early life</li>
<li>Worked as a glover to earn a living, but also served as organist in a handful of churches</li>
<li>Known to his contemporaries as the “country psalm-singer” for his work instructing local church choirs</li>
<li>The tune <cite class="tune">Wareham</cite> is named for his birthplace and home</li>
<li>Originally written as a setting for Psalm 36 in Knapp’s <cite class="book">Set of New Psalm Tunes and Anthems</cite></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Green’s text is not shy about making his point that Christ’s church needs to be an <em>active</em> church. At the same time, there are a number of phrases that need closer inspection to fully comprehend. What do you understand the following phrases to mean?
<ul>
<li>(Verse 1): “test its heritage”</li>
<li>(Verse 1): “keep on rising from the dead”</li>
<li>(Verse 2): “never live before they die”</li>
<li>(Verse 4): “fever in our blood”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="come_ye_thankful_people_come" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/come_ye_thankful_people_come">Come, Ye Thankful People, Come</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="henry_alford">Henry Alford</a> (1810–1871), 1844</p>
<ul>
<li>Born into a family with many clergy, studied at Cambridge and was ordained in the Anglican church</li>
<li>Served for 18 years in the rural community of Wymeswold</li>
<li>Notable for his scholarly work, published a four-volume commentary on the Greek New Testament</li>
<li>Although first published in 1844, Alford revised this text significantly in 1865 and 1867</li>
<li>This was in part due to alterations made in <cite class="book">Hymns Ancient and Modern</cite> that Alford was highly unhappy with</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="george_job_elvey">George Job Elvey</a> (1816–1893), 1856</p>
<ul>
<li>Born into a musical family in Canterbury with a long history with Canterbury Cathedral</li>
<li>Taught and worked with members of the Royal Family, eventually knighted in 1871</li>
<li>Originally wrote this tune for a text “Hark! The Song of Jubilee” by <span id="james_montgomery">James Montgomery</a> (author of “Hail to the Lord’s Anointed”)</li>
<li>Consistently paired with “Come, Ye Thankful People” since the 1861 edition of <cite class="book">Hymns Ancient and Modern</cite></li>
<li>The name <cite class="tune">St. George’s Windsor</cite> is taken from the chapel where Elvey was organist for 47 years</li>
<li>Also known for his tune <cite class="tune">Diademata</cite> used for “Crown Him With Many Crowns”</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At first glance, this seems to be a fairly standard hymn of thanks to God, but actually the text is aimed at teaching as well as praise. What is Alford’s main lesson here that he wants us to learn?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The culmination of the hymn is found in the last verse, which mirrors the opening verse but recasts it in the light of Christ’s second coming. In what way is our own thankfulness related to the return of Christ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
