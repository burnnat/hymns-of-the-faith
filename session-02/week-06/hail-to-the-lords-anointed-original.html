	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>Text: James Montgomery, 1821</p>
<p>Hail to the Lord’s Anointed,<br>
Great David’s greater Son!<br>
Hail, in the time appointed,<br>
His reign on earth begun!<br>
He comes to break oppression,<br>
To set the captive free,<br>
To take away transgression,<br>
And rule in equity.</p>
<p>He comes with succor speedy,<br>
To those who suffer wrong;<br>
To help the poor and needy,<br>
And bid the weak be strong;<br>
To give them songs for sighing,<br>
Their darkness turn to light,<br>
Whose souls, condemned and dying,<br>
Were precious in His sight.</p>
<p>He shall descend like showers<br>
Upon the fruitful earth,<br>
And love, joy, hope, like flowers,<br>
Spring in His path to birth;<br>
Before Him, on the mountains,<br>
Shall peace, the herald, go;<br>
And righteousness, like fountains,<br>
From hill to valley flow.</p>
<p>Arabia’s desert-ranger<br>
To Him shall bow the knee;<br>
The Ethiopian stranger<br>
His glory come to see;<br>
With offerings of devotion<br>
Ships from the isles shall meet,<br>
To pour the wealth of ocean<br>
In tribute at his feet.</p>
<p>Kings shall fall down before Him,<br>
And gold and incense bring;<br>
All nations shall adore Him,<br>
His praise all people sing;<br>
To Him shall prayer unceasing<br>
And daily vows ascend,<br>
His kingdom still increasing,<br>
A kingdom without end.</p>
<p>O’er every foe victorious,<br>
He on His throne shall rest;<br>
From age to age more glorious,<br>
All-blessing and all-blest.<br>
The tide of time shall never<br>
His covenant remove;<br>
His name shall stand for ever,<br>
His name – what is it? Love!</p>
