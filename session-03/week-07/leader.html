<p>Text: <span id="gregory">Pope Gregory I</a> (c. 540–604), c. 600</p>
<ul>
<li>Born to a wealthy Roman family, son of a Roman senator, great-great-grandson of Pope Felix III</li>
<li>Well-educated (but could not read Greek), trained for a career in public service, becoming Prefect of Rome by age 30</li>
<li>Following the death of his father, devoted his life work and large inheritance to the church</li>
<li>Founded no less than six monasteries, living as a Benedictine monk before being made a cardinal in 577 and pope in 590</li>
<li>Known for advancing missionary work in ancient Britain, and for beginning to standardize church liturgy and music eventually leading to Gregorian plainchant centuries later</li>
<li>True authorship is unknown, earliest surviving copy is from c. 900; most attribute the hymn to Gregory, others suggest <span id="alcuin">Alcuin of York</a> (735–804)</li>
<li>Translated from Latin to English by <span id="percy_dearmer">Percy Dearmer</a> for the <cite class="book">English Hymnal</cite> of 1906</li>

<li>Although mistakenly named <cite class="tune">Christe Sanctorum</cite>, the original chant was actally “Christe <em>pastorum</em>”</li>
<li>The first known publication is from a 1681 collection of French chants, <cite class="book">Antiphonarium Parisiense</cite></li>
<li>Scholars agree that the style of the chant is likely not medieval in origin, but from the 17th century</li>

<p>Text: <span id="rabanus_maurus">Rabanus Maurus</a> (c. 776–856), c. 800</p>
<ul>
<li>Frankish by birth; the Franks were a Germanic tribe that controlled much of western Europe during the early medieval period</li>
<li>Born in Mainz, became a Benedictine monk in Hesse, both cities in what is today central Germany</li>
<li>At the request of his abbot, traveled to Tours (in modern-day France) to study under <span id="alcuin">Alcuin of York</a></li>
<li>Upon return, directed the abbey school and then became abbot himself in 822</li>
<li>Following a short retirement in 842, was appointed Archbishob of Mainz in 847</li>
<li>In addition to Latin poetry, he wrote extensive commentaries on scripture and an early German-Latin dictionary</li>
<li>This English translation is from John Cosin (later an Anglican bishop), from his 1627 <cite class="book">Collection of Private Devotions</cite> and used at the coronation of King Charles I<br>
Tune: <span id="traditional">Traditional Plainchant</a>, c. 800</li>
<li>The tune goes by the same Latin name of <cite class="tune">Veni Creator Spiritus</cite>, since it originated as a plainchant tune for this text</li>
<li>The first recorded occasion on which it was sung was at the Council of Reims in 1049</li>
<li>The chant melody is in Mode VIII of the traditional Gregorian system, with the main “final” tone being what we would consider the fifth note of the major scale</li>

<li>Final verse of the original is a doxology (as is also found in “Father, We Praise Thee”)</li>
