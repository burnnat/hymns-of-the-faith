		<h2><a id="shackled_by_a_heavy_burden" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/shackled_by_a_heavy_burden">He Touched Me</a></h2>
<p>Text and Tune: <span id="bill_gaither">Bill Gaither</a> (1936– ), 1963</p>
<ul>
<li>Born and raised in Alexandria, Indiana, a small rural town</li>
<li>Formed the Bill Gaither Trio in 1956, while a student at Anderson University (also in Indiana)</li>
<li>Following graduation with an English major and music minor, started work as a high school English teacher in 1959</li>
<li>After difficulty maintaining both teaching and music careers, became a full-time musician in 1967</li>
<li>“He Touched Me” was his first major success in songwriting, recorded by artists from Jimmy Durante to Elvis Presley</li>
<li>The song idea was suggested by a minister in the Church of God, the father of his friend and fellow singer Doug Oldham</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Given that this was the Gaithers’ first big hit, what qualities do you see (in both text and tune) that account for its popularity? What is the central message?</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="twas_a_life_filled_with_aimless_desperat" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/twas_a_life_filled_with_aimless_desperat">The Old Rugged Cross Made The Difference</a></h2>
<p>Text and Tune: Bill Gaither (1936– ), <span id="gloria_gaither">Gloria Gaither</a> (1942– ), 1970</p>
<ul>
<li>Gloria grew up in the Battle Creek area of Michigan and even worked for the Kellogg company for a time</li>
<li>Also attended Anderson University and studied English, French, and Sociology</li>
<li>Met Bill when they were both teachers at Alexandria Monroe High School, and married in 1962</li>
<li>They have co-written countless songs together, where Gloria typically provides the words and Bill the music</li>
<li>In addition, Gloria is a published author of over 40 books, half of them for children</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This hymn shares a similar theme with “He Touched Me” but approached in a different way. What are the main differences you see between the two? Which do you find more effective?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title and chorus directly reference the classic gospel hymn <a id="on_a_hill_far_away_stood_an_old_rugged" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/on_a_hill_far_away_stood_an_old_rugged">“The Old Rugged Cross”</a> from the early 1900s. What connections between the two songs do you notice?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hear My Song, Lord</h2>
<p>Text and Tune: Bill Gaither (1936– ), Gloria Gaither (1942– ), 1989</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to continuing to perform and record, formed the Gaither Music Company serving as record label, publisher, and retail store</li>
<li>Formed the Gaither Vocal Band in 1981 to build on the success of the Bill Gaither Trio</li>
<li>Many famous contemporary Christian musicians launched their careers touring with the Gaithers, including Michael W. Smith, Sandi Patty, Steve Green, Amy Grant, and others</li>
<li>In 1991, debuted the Gaither Homecoming, a video and record series (and later tour) compiling the best of Southern gospel music</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In what ways do you see a modern “praise chorus” influnce on this song? At the same time, are there other features that make it still seem “Gaither-like”?</li>
</ol>
