<p>Text: <span id="johann_heermann">Johann Heermann</a> (1585–1657), 1630</p>
<ul>
<li>Eldest surviving child in a German Lutheran family, born in Silesia, part of modern-day Poland</li>
<li>Studied under a variety of tutors between intermittent bouts of severe illness</li>
<li>Eventually employed as a private tutor for the son of theologian Valerius Herberger, who recognized Heermann’s poetic talent and encouraged him to publish and study at university</li>
<li>Studies cut short by more health issues, in 1611 he returned home and was appointed deacon to a nearby church in Köben whose pastor was old and infirm</li>
<li>A week after beginning work, the pastor died and Heermann took over as interim pastor for the congregation, then made permanent shortly after and remained there for over 20 years</li>
<li>During his tenure, he saw the town hit by the black plague, a massive fire, and ransacking during the Thirty Years’ War, in addition to the death of his wife, loss of possessions, and continued ill spells</li>
<li>While his early poetry was in Latin, this text is from a later collection of German devotional poems titled <cite class="book">Devoti musica cordis</cite></li>
<li>Originally 15 verses, it was based on a Latin meditation written by <span id="john_of_fécamp">John of Fécamp</a>, an abbot in Normandy in the 11th century (though sometimes attributed to St. Augustine)</li>
<li>This translation into English is by <span id="robert_bridges">Robert Bridges</a> in 1897, though one by <span id="catherine_winkworth">Catherine Winkworth</a> (“O dearest Jesus, what law hast Thou broken”) is also popular</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="johann_crüger">Johann Crüger</a> (1598–1662), 1640</p>
<ul>
<li>Son of an innkeeper, born in Groß Breesen, which today is directly on the German-Polish border</li>
<li>Studied both music and theology, first in Berlin and then later at the University of Wittenberg</li>
<li>Worked first as a tutor, then as a schoolteacher and choirmaster at the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas’ Church, founded around AD 1220, the oldest in Berlin)</li>
<li>Also known as composer of the chorale tune for “Now Thank We All Our God”, and edited a number of influential Lutheran hymnals</li>
<li>This tune <cite class="tune">Herzliebster Jesu</cite> comes from his first edited hymnal, containing 248 hymns total</li>
<li>Later popularized by <span id="johann_sebastian_bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> who used it three times in his “St. Matthew Passion” and twice in the “St. John Passion”</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>What stands out as unique about this hymn, compared to other “passion” hymns? What particular insight or perspective does it give you?
<ul>
<li>The use of sapphic meter (11.11.11.5) is uncommon, but not unprecedented</li>
<li>Takes an individual, personal view of the passion
<ul>
<li>Emphasizes personal culpability in Christ’s death: “my treason”, “I crucified thee”</li>
<li>Similarly, Christ’s sacrifice is given to us personally: “for me … was thy incarnation”, “for my salvation”</li>
<li>Also necessitates a personal response: “I do adore thee, and will ever pray thee”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The leading word “ah” instead of the more common “O” gives a unique flavor
<ul>
<li>No other well-known hymn starts with “ah” in the first line (though there are lesser-known examples from both Watts and Wesley)</li>
<li>Feels much like the German “ach”, although it is not present in the original</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2><a id="i_cannot_tell_why_he_whom_angels_worship" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/i_cannot_tell_why_he_whom_angels_worship">I Cannot Tell</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="william_young_fullerton">William Young Fullerton</a> (1857–1932), 1920</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in Belfast, Ireland, influenced as a young adult by the preaching of English Baptist <span id="charles_spurgeon">Charles Spurgeon</a></li>
<li>Spurgeon later became a friend and mentor, and Fullerton helped prepare his manuscripts for publication</li>
<li>Prominent in the Baptist church, Fullerton compiled hymnals and wrote a number of books in addition to serving as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, and later president of the Baptist Union</li>
<li>Better known for biographies (of Spurgeon, <span id="john_bunyan">John Bunyan</a>, and others), this is his only hymn in common use</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="traditional">Traditional Irish</a></p>
<ul>
<li>An Irish folk tune, its name <cite class="tune">Londonderry Air</cite> comes from the Irish county where it was first collected by one <span id="jane_ross">Jane Ross</a></li>
<li>Since no other folk tune collectors had recorded the tune independently, scholars believe Ross was fooled by the use of rubato and mistakenly transcribed the tune in 4/4 rather than 3/4 time</li>
<li>If that is true, the tune appears to be a derivative of a much older tune “Aisling an Óigfhir”</li>
<li>Most will recognize the tune as commonly used with the lyrics “O Danny Boy”, written in 1910</li>
<li>Other hymns using this tune include texts written by <span id="timothy_dudley-smith">Timothy Dudley-Smith</a>, <span id="kristyn_getty">Kristyn Getty</a>, and more</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>What stands out as unique about this hymn, compared to other “passion” hymns? What particular insight or perspective does it give you?
<ul>
<li>Not simply a “passion” hymn, gives a full view of God’s plan from incarnation to sacrifice to second coming</li>
<li>Acknowledges the presence of the unknown in the Christian life: “I cannot tell … but this I know …”
<ul>
<li>The things we “know” are rooted both in scripture and in personal experience</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2><a id="my_song_is_love_unknown" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/my_song_is_love_unknown">My Song Is Love Unknown</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="samuel_crossman">Samuel Crossman</a> (1624–1684), 1664</p>
<ul>
<li>An Anglican minister, interestingly he pastored two congregations: one Anglican, one Puritan</li>
<li>Sympathetic to Puritan ideas, he attended the Savoy Conference of 1661, attempting to revise the <cite class="book">Book of Common Prayer</cite> to serve both Anglicans and Puritans</li>
<li>With the conference unsuccessful, the 1662 Act of Uniformity expelled Crossman and 2,000 other ministers from the Anglican church</li>
<li>Crossman later renounced Puritan theology and in 1665 was reinstated to a chaplaincy in Bristol</li>
<li>This text was written during his time outside the Church of England, and published in his poetry collection <cite class="book">The Young Man’s Meditation</cite></li>
<li>It shows clear influence, even borrowing some key phrases, from <span id="george_herbert">George Herbert</a>’s poem “The Sacrifice” from his poetry collection titled <cite class="book">The Temple</cite></li>
<li>However, it wasn’t used as a hymn until after his death, appearing in the <cite class="book">Anglican Hymn Book</cite> of 1686</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="john_ireland">John Ireland</a> (1879–1962), 1919</p>
<ul>
<li>Although of Scottish ancestry, Ireland was born and raised in Cheshire, England</li>
<li>His father was 70 years old at the time of his birth, and though his mother was 30 years younger, both had died before he turned 16</li>
<li>Trained at the Royal College of Music studying composition under Charles Villiers Stanford, he later returned to teach from 1923 to 1939</li>
<li>Best known for his secular piano and chamber music music, but particularly his song cycles on texts by English poets Shakespeare, Blake, Hardy, and others</li>
<li>His tune <cite class="tune">Love Unknown</cite> was written specifically for this text in <cite class="book">The Public School Hymn Book</cite> of 1919</li>
<li>Reportedly, after receiving the request from hymnal editor <span id="geoffrey_shaw">Geoffrey Shaw</a>, he wrote the tune in 15 minutes on a scrap of paper</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>What stands out as unique about this hymn, compared to other “passion” hymns? What particular insight or perspective does it give you?
<ul>
<li>The meter 6.6.6.6.4.4.4.4 is somewhat unusual, with the only other popular example being “Rejoice, the Lord is King”
<ul>
<li>Unlike “Rejoice”, whose last two lines are a constant refrain, “My Song” has an inverted double rhyme in the last two lines of each stanza</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The primary focus is on the dichotomy of the crucifixion:
<ul>
<li>“love to the loveless shown”</li>
<li>“none the longed-for Christ would know”</li>
<li>“a murderer they save / the Prince of Life they slay”</li>
<li>“cheerful he to suffering goes”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The text is emotional, but not in the typical sadness and gratefulness we normally find; astonishment, disbelief show in questions and exclamations:
<ul>
<li>“O who am I …?”</li>
<li>“Oh my Friend, my Friend indeed …!”</li>
<li>Sweet injuries!&quot;</li>
<li>“Why, what hath my Lord done?”</li>
<li>“What may I say?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
