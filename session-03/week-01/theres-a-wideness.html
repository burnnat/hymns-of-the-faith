		<h1 class="title">Week 1: There&#x27;s a Wideness in God&#x27;s Mercy</h1>
	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>Text: Frederick Faber, 1862</p>
<p>Souls of men! Why will ye scatter like a crowd of frightened sheep?<br>
Foolish hearts! Why will ye wander from a love so true and deep?</p>
<p>Was there ever kindest shepherd half so gentle, half so sweet,<br>
As the Saviour who would have us come and gather round His feet?</p>
<p>It is God: His love looks mighty, but is mightier than it seems:<br>
’Tis our Father: and His fondness goes far out beyond our dreams.</p>
<p>There’s a wideness in God’s mercy, like the wideness of the sea:<br>
There’s a kindness in His justice, which is more than liberty.</p>
<p>There is no place where earth’s sorrows are more felt than up in heaven;<br>
There is no place where earth’s failings have such kindly judgment given.</p>
<p>There is welcome for the sinner, and more graces for the good;<br>
There is mercy with the Saviour; there is healing in His blood.</p>
<p>There is grace enough for thousands of new worlds as great as this;<br>
There is room for fresh creations in that upper home of bliss.</p>
<p>For the love of God is broader than the measures of man’s mind;<br>
And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind.</p>
<p>But we make His love too narrow by false limits of our own;<br>
And we magnify His strictness with a zeal He will not own.</p>
<p>There is plentiful redemption in the blood that has been shed;<br>
There is joy for all the members in the sorrows of the Head.</p>
<p>’Tis not all we owe to Jesus; it is something more than all;<br>
Greater good because of evil, larger mercy through the fall.</p>
<p>Pining souls! Come nearer Jesus, and O come not doubting thus,<br>
But with faith that trusts more bravely his huge tenderness for us.</p>
<p>If our love were but more simple, we should take Him at His word;<br>
And our lives would be all sunshine in the sweetness of our Lord.</p>
