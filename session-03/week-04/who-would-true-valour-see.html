	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>Text: John Bunyan, 1684</p>
<p>Who would true Valour see,<br>
Let him come hither;<br>
One here will Constant be,<br>
Come Wind, come Weather.<br>
There’s no Discouragement<br>
Shall make him once Relent<br>
His first avow’d Intent<br>
To be a Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Whoso beset him round<br>
With dismal Storys,<br>
Do but themselves confound;<br>
His strength the more is.<br>
No Lyon can him fright,<br>
He’ll with a Gyant Fight,<br>
But he will have a right<br>
To be a Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Hobgoblin nor foul Fiend<br>
Can daunt his Spirit:<br>
He knows, he at the end<br>
Shall Life Inherit.<br>
Then Fancies fly away,<br>
He’ll fear not what men say;<br>
He’ll labor Night and Day<br>
To be a Pilgrim.</p>
