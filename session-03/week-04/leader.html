<p>Text: <span id="frances_havergal">Frances Havergal</a> (1836–1879), 1874</p>
<ul>
<li>Daughter of an Anglican minister, <span id="william_henry_havergal">William Henry Havergal</a>, who was devoted to improving the music of the Church of England
<ul>
<li>A visit to his church was striking to <span id="lowell_mason">Lowell Mason</a>, who reported it was far in advance of anywhere else in England at the time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Largely self-taught, poor health prevented her from attending school regularly
<ul>
<li>Even so, she was very bright and became proficient in Hebrew, Greek, French, German, and Italian</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evangelically-minded, printed most of her hymns as leaflets rather than books for easy distribution</li>
<li>By her own account, this text was written in a single night after a visit to a house of 10 people who all gave themselves to Christ</li>
<li>Insisted that the text be exclusively paired with her father’s tune <cite class="tune">Patmos</cite>, as it was originally
<ul>
<li>Patmos uses a 7.7.7.7 meter, which means two pairs of couplets per verse (for a total of six)</li>
<li>The current favorite <cite class="tune">Hendon</cite> is 77.77.77, still only two couplets per verse but repeats the second couplet to fill the meter</li>
<li>Our tune <cite class="tune">Messiah</cite>) uses 7.7.7.7 D for longer verses of four couplets each (resulting in only three verses total)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="ferdinand_hérold">Ferdinand Hérold</a> (1791–1833), 1839</p>
<ul>
<li>Born Louis Joseph Ferdinand Hérold in the Alsace region of France, an only child</li>
<li>His father was a pianist and composer, but discouraged him from a career in music</li>
<li>After his father’s death in 1802, entered the Paris Conservatory of music</li>
<li>Moved to Naples, Italy in 1815 for health reasons, then to Austria and back to Paris due to political turmoil</li>
<li>Well known for his operas, of which he wrote more than 20 (he also wrote ballets and some concert pieces)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Consider the list of items offered up to God: life, time, hands, feet, voice, lips, wealth, mind, will, heart, love, and self. Are any of these more surprising or challenging than the others? Which ones speak to you personally, and what does it look like to <em>fully</em> sacrifice that?
<ul>
<li>“hands”: the word “impulse” implies reacting to every small direction, and with immediacy - no delay</li>
<li>“voice”: singing <em>only</em> for God means excluding everything else; Havergal was a talented voice and piano performer, but after 1873 refused to sing anything but sacred music</li>
<li>“intellect”: significant considering how smart Havergal was, its “power” is often underrated and overlooked
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A1-2">Romans 12:1-2</a> pairs the physical “bodies as a living sacrifice” with the intellectual “renewal of your mind”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“silver and gold”: on one occasion, Havergal donated nearly all of her jewelry to charity, saying:
<blockquote>
<p>“Take my silver and my gold” now means shipping off all my ornaments … to the Church Missionary society where they will be accepted and disposed of for me… I had no idea I had such a jeweller’s shop; nearly fifty articles are being packed off. I don’t think I need tell you I never packed a box with such pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>“heart”: becoming a “royal throne” means inviting Jesus to reside there, as well as subjugating it to Him
<ul>
<li>Could also be read as forgoing earthly love - Havergal never married</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“love”: to “pour at Thy feet” matches pouring oil on Jesus’ feet after He raised Lazarus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2012%3A3">John 12:3</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Text: <span id="henry_francis_lyte">Henry Francis Lyte</a> (1793–1847), 1824</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in Scotland, abandoned by his father, orphaned at a young age after the death of his mother</li>
<li>Struggling from lack of money and ill health, became an Anglican minister at 21 years old</li>
<li>Experienced a re-invigoration of his faith after the death of a colleague in 1818, jump-starting his hymnwriting</li>
<li>In 1823, was transferred to a parish in Lower Brixham, Devonshire, where he would spend most of his career</li>
<li>This text was written shortly after his move to Brixham</li>
<li>Best-known hymns include “Abide With Me” and “Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven”</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="anonymous">Anonymous</a>, 1831</p>
<ul>
<li>First published in the hymnal <cite class="book">Christian Lyre</cite> of 1831</li>
<li>Often attributed to <span id="wolfgang_amadeus_mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, though no evidence exists to support that claim</li>
<li>The original name given was <cite class="tune">Disciple</cite>, only appearing as <cite class="tune">Ellesdie</cite> later</li>
<li>The meaning of the name is uncertain, though some have theorized it could stand for “L. S. D.”, possibly the initials of the composer</li>
<li>The most popular harmonization was written by <span id="hubert_main">Hubert Main</a> in 1873; ours is from <span id="austin_lovelace">Austin Lovelace</a>, organist, composer, and committee member for the 1969 <cite class="book">Methodist Hymnal</cite></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the hymn, Lyte lists a number of different sacrifices to be made in following Jesus - list all you can find, along with the hymn’s explanation why each is worthwhile.</p>
<ul>
<li>“destitute”: spiritual riches are greater than earthly ones (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010%3A23-31">Mark 10:23-31</a>)</li>
<li>“despised”, “forsaken”: the same people despised and abandoned Jesus too; God will not forsake or deceive you.</li>
<li>“trouble”, “distress”: only brings us closer to God through trust and dependence on Him</li>
<li>“faith” and “prayer” are the tools to get us through life; God Himself guides us; “hope” fixes our sight on the end goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing what you do about Lyte’s background, how do you see his experiences reflected in this hymn?</p>
<ul>
<li>No parents, no money, poor health, (“destitute”, “forsaken”, “life with trials…”)</li>
<li>Many parallels with “Abide With Me”:
<ul>
<li>“foes may hate, and friends may shun me” … “other helpers fail and comforts flee”</li>
<li>“swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day” … “swift shall pass thy pilgrim days”</li>
<li>“God’s own hand shall guide thee there” … “Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quiet and bookish, not a terribly social person
<ul>
<li>“Man may trouble and distress me”</li>
<li>“Human hearts and looks deceive me”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="he_who_would_valiant_be" href="https://www.hymnary.org/text/he_who_would_valiant_be">All Who Would Valiant Be</a></h2>
<p>Text: <span id="john_bunyan">John Bunyan</a> (1628–1688), 1684</p>
<ul>
<li>Faught in the English Civil War at age 16, after leaving the army became a tinker</li>
<li>Did not become a devout Christian until after his marriage, influenced by his wife (whose name is unknown)</li>
<li>Joined a Baptist church that encouraged him to preach and evangelize in the community</li>
<li>Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, was jailed for three months as a non-conformist</li>
<li>At a release hearing, refused to agree to cease preaching and continued in imprisonment for 12 years</li>
<li>While living in jail he wrote numerous books, including <cite class="book">The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite> from which this hymn is taken</li>
<li>The text (originally a poem) comes near the end of the book, at the end of a conversation between “Mr. Great-heart” and “Mr. Valiant-for-truth”</li>
<li>Heavily modified for inclusion in the 1906 <cite class="book">English Hymnal</cite> by <span id="percy_dearmer">Percy Dearmer</a>, its editor</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="traditional">Traditional English</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on a folk tune collected and harmonized by <span id="ralph_vaughan_williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> for this text in the <cite class="book">English Hymnal</cite></li>
<li>The name <cite class="tune">Monk’s Gate</cite> is the name of a small town in Sussex, England where Vaughan Williams heard the tune</li>
<li>Its origins are as a sea song beginning, “Our captain calls all hands on board tomorrow…”</li>
<li>The source, a Mrs. Harriet Verrall, also introduced Vaughan Williams to the <cite class="tune">Sussex Carol</cite> tune (“On Christmas Night All Christians Sing”)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compare the hymn text against Bunyan’s original. While Dearmer’s version has been standard for quite a while, some recent hymnals are returning to the original text (including the Church of England’s <cite class="book">Common Praise</cite>. Which do you think is more appropriate for use today?</p>
<ul>
<li>Dearmer himself said:
<blockquote>
<p>But when … we had made a great hymn, it became easy for our imitators to complain that we had altered the words. We felt that we had done rightly; and that no one would have been more distressed than Bunyan himself to have people singing about hobgoblins in church. He had not written it for a hymn, and it was not suitable as a hymn without adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><cite class="book">The Gospel in Hymns</cite> says:
<blockquote>
<p>…in our “cultured” times, editors have seen fit to tone down [Bunyan’s] picturesque particulars into colorless generalities.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><cite class="book">The Hymnal 1940 Companion</cite> says (about including the original text):
<blockquote>
<p>Bunyan’s burly song strikes a new and welcome note in our Hymnal. The quaint sincerity of the words stirs us out of our easygoing dull Christianity to the thrill of great adventure.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you characterize the difference in perspective on “self-sacrifice” between the three hymns? Do you get a fuller picture of the topic looking at all three together?</p>
<ul>
<li>Havergal is mainly concerned with sacrifices that we <em>choose</em> to make, but necessary to grow closer to Christ
<ul>
<li>Takes a small-scale view of individual things we should be doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lyte is concerned with sacrifices that are a down-stream <em>effect</em> of our choice to follow Jesus, placed on us by other people (and by the world)
<ul>
<li>Looks a “point-in-time” in the middle of the Christian walk, with a few specifics but looking forward to heaven as the goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bunyan takes both and works them into a hymn of encouragement, to continue on the path we have already started
<ul>
<li>Takes a large-scale view of the whole Christian journey, in broad strokes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
