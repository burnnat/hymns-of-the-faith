<ul>
<li>Born in Bonn, Germany, following two generations of musicians, and demonstrated talent at an early age</li>
<li>Hoping to replicate Mozart’s success as a child prodigy, his father pushed him in strict musical study and traveling performances</li>
<li>Following the death of his mother at age 17 and his father’s fall into alcoholism, took responsibility of his two younger brothers</li>

<li>It was later adopted as the official anthem of the European Union</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does the hymn text explore the idea of “joy” without being shallow or naive? What are some of the reasons it gives to be joyful?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How well do the text and tune fit together, and why?</p>
</li>

<p>Text: <span id="cecil_spring-rice">Cecil Spring-Rice</a> (1859–1918), 1908</p>

<li>Sent the full text in a letter to <span id="william_jennings_bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> shortly before his death</li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="gustav_holst">Gustav Holst</a> (1874–1934), 1914</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in England, his father was an organist and church choir director</li>
<li>Interested in composition from an early age, studied at the Royal College of Music on scholarship, where he met fellow student and friend <span id="ralph_vaughan_williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a></li>
<li>Best known for his large-scale orchestral works and music for wind band, as one of the first composers to write “serious” music for the ensemble</li>
<li>Originally wrote this tune for his orchestral suite “The Planets”, in the central movement “Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity”</li>
<li>Adapted as a hymn tune for this text in 1921, suggested by Spring-Rice’s daughter, a student at St Paul’s Girls School where Holst was music director</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rarely used outside of Great Britain, even there the hymn has fallen out of favor in some circles because of its equivalence between loyalty to nation and loyalty to God. Do you think this criticism is appropriate, and why or why not?</p>

<p>How well do the text and tune fit together, and why?</p>

<p>Text: <span id="john_newton">John Newton</a> (1725–1807), 1779</p>
<ul>
<li>Son of a ship’s captain, headed to sea with his father four years after the death of his mother at age 7</li>
<li>Drafted into service in the Royal Navy at 18, unsuccessfully attempted to desert, then held captive in Aftrica by a slave trader</li>

<li>Later married, became ordained in the Church of England, began to speak out against the slave trade</li>
<li>Published <cite class="book">Olney Hymns</cite> in 1779 through collaboration with his friend and poet <span id="william_cowper">William Cowper</a></li>
<li>This text was included in Book 1 of the collection (“On Select Texts of Scripture”) and paired with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2033%3A20-21">Isaiah 33:20-21</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Tune: <span id="joseph_haydn">Joseph Haydn</a> (1732–1809), 1797</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in a small Austrian village near the Hungarian border, son of a weelwright who was also an amateur musician and served as town mayor</li>
<li>Sent at age 6 to live with a relative in a larger city in the hopes of recieving a proper musical education</li>
<li>After early struggles to find employment, eventually obtained patronage from a string of Austrian aristocrats</li>
<li>Best known for his instrumental music, particularly his symphonies and string quartets</li>
<li>The tune was written as an unofficial Austrian national anthem with the lyrics “Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser” (“God Save Emporer Franz”) inspired by the popularity of the English anthem “God Save the King”</li>
<li>Its name <cite class="tune">Austria</cite> reflects these roots (sometimes also appears as <cite class="tune">Austrian Hymn</cite>)</li>
<li>Incorporated into the second movement of Haydn’s “Emporer” string quartet as a theme and variations</li>
<li>Later used for the German nation anthem “Deutschland über alles”, notably by the Nazi party during World War II</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Newton melds together a wide range of scriptural quotes and images to build up a picture of the New Jerusalem (Zion) as a metaphor for Christ’s church. What references stick out to you, and what do they teach about the church?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How well do the text and tune fit together, and why?</p>
