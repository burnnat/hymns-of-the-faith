“Glory to the King of Kings,
Peace on Earth, and Mercy mild,
God and Sinners reconcil’d!”
<p>Joyful all ye Nations rise,<br>
Join the Triumph of the Skies;<br>
Universal Nature say,<br>
“Christ the Lord is born to Day!”</p>
<p>Christ, by highest Heav’n ador’d,<br>
Christ, the Everlasting Lord,<br>
Late in Time behold him come,<br>
Offspring of a Virgin’s Womb.</p>
<p>Veil’d in Flesh, the Godhead see,<br>
Hail th’ Incarnate Deity!<br>
Pleas’d as Man with Men t’appear,<br>
Jesus, our Immanuel here!</p>
<p>Hail the Heav’nly Prince of Peace!<br>
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!<br>
Light and Life to All he brings,<br>
Ris’n with Healing in his Wings.</p>
<p>Mild he lays his Glory by;<br>
Born; that Man no more may die,<br>
Born; to raise the Sons of Earth,<br>
Born; to give them Second Birth.</p>
<p>Come, Desire of Nations, come,<br>
Fix in Us thy humble Home,<br>
Rise, the Woman’s Conqu’ring Seed,<br>
Bruise in Us the Serpent’s Head.</p>
<p>Now display thy saving Pow’r,<br>
Ruin’d Nature now restore,<br>
Now in Mystic Union join<br>
Thine to Ours, and Ours to Thine.</p>
<p>Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface,<br>
Stamp thy Image in its Place,<br>
Second Adam from above,<br>
Reinstate us in thy Love.</p>
<p>Let us Thee, tho’ lost, regain,<br>
Thee, the Life, the Heav’nly Man:<br>
O! to All Thyself impart,<br>
Form’d in each Believing Heart.</td><td>Of the Father sole begotten,<br>
Ere the worlds began to be,<br>
He the Alpha and Omega,<br>
He the source, the ending he,<br>
Of the things that are, that have been,<br>
And that future years shall see,<br>
Evermore and evermore.</p>
<p>He is here, whom seers in old time<br>
Chaunted of, while ages ran;<br>
Whom the writings of the Prophets<br>
Promised since the world began:<br>
Then foretold, now manifested,<br>
To receive the praise of man,<br>
Evermore and evermore.</p>
<p>O that ever-blessed birthday,<br>
When the Virgin, full of grace,<br>
Of the Holy Ghost incarnate<br>
Bare the Saviour of our race;<br>
And that Child, the world’s Redeemer,<br>
First display’d his sacred face,<br>
Evermore and evermore.</p>
<p>Praise him, O ye Heavens of Heavens!<br>
Praise him, Angels in the height<br>
Every Power and every Virtue<br>
Sing the praise of God aright:<br>
Let no tongue of man be silent,<br>
Let each heart and voice unite,<br>
Evermore and evermore.</p>
<p>Thee let age, and thee let manhood,<br>
Thee let quires of infants sing;<br>
Thee the matrons and the virgins,<br>
And the children answering:<br>
Let their modest song re-echo,<br>
And their heart its praises bring,<br>
Evermore and evermore.</p>
<p>Laud and honour to the Father,<br>
Laud and honour to the Son,<br>
Laud and honour to the Spirit,<br>
Ever Three and ever One:<br>
Consubstantial, Co-eternal,<br>
While unending ages run,<br>
Evermore and evermore.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>
