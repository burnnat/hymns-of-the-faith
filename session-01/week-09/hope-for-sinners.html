		<h1 class="title">Week 9: Hope for Sinners</h1>
	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>Text: Albert Midlane, 1862</p>
<p>Sinner, where is room for doubting?<br>
Has not Jesus died for sin?<br>
Did He not in resurrection<br>
Victory over Satan win?</p>
<p>Hear Him on the cross exclaiming —<br>
“It is finish’d,” ere He died;<br>
See Him in His mercy saving,<br>
One there hanging by His side.</p>
<p>’Twas for sinners that He suffer’d<br>
Agonies unspeakable;<br>
Canst thou doubt thou art a sinner?<br>
If thou canst — then hope farewell.</p>
<p>But, believing what is written —<br>
“All are guilty” — “dead in sin,”<br>
Looking to the Crucified One<br>
Hope shall rise thy soul within.</p>
<p>Hope and peace, and joy unfailing,<br>
Through the Saviour’s precious blood,<br>
All thy crimson sins forgiven,<br>
And thy soul brought nigh to God.</p>
