		<h1 class="title">Week 10: Lo, He Cometh</h1>
	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>Text: John Cennick, 1750</p>
<p>Lo! He cometh, countless trumpets<br>
Blow before his bloody sign!<br>
’Midst ten thousand saints and angels,<br>
See the Crucified shine.<br>
Allelujah!<br>
Welcome, welcome bleeding Lamb!</p>
<p>Now His merits by the harpers,<br>
Thro’ the eternal deeps resounds!<br>
Now resplendent shine His nailprints,<br>
Every eye shall see His wounds!<br>
They who pierced Him,<br>
Shall at His appearing wail.</p>
<p>Every island, sea, and mountain,<br>
Heaven and earth shall flee away!<br>
All who hate Him must, ashamed,<br>
Hear the trump proclaim His day:<br>
Come to judgment!<br>
Stand before the Son of Man!</p>
<p>All who love Him view His glory,<br>
Shining in His bruised Face:<br>
His dear Person on the rainbow,<br>
Now His people’s heads shall raise:<br>
Happy mourners!<br>
Now on clouds He comes! He comes!</p>
<p>Now redemption, long expected,<br>
See, in solemn pomp appear:<br>
All His people, once despised,<br>
Now shall meet Him in the air:<br>
Allelujah!<br>
Now the promised kingdom’s come!</p>
<p>View Him smiling, now determined<br>
Every evil to destroy!<br>
All the nations now shall sing Him<br>
Songs of everlasting joy!<br>
O come quickly!<br>
Allelujah! Come Lord, come!</p>
