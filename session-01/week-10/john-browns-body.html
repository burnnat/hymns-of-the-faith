		<h2>John Brown’s Body</h2>
<p>Text: Traditional American, 1861</p>
<p>John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave, (x3)<br>
His soul is marching on.</p>
<p><em>Chorus:</em><br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah,<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah,<br>
His soul is marching on.</p>
<p>He’s gone to be a soldier in the Army of the Lord, (x3)<br>
His soul is marching on.<br>
<em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>John Brown’s knapsack is strapped upon his back, (x3)<br>
His soul is marching on.<br>
<em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>His pet lambs will meet him on the way, (x3)<br>
They go marching on.<br>
<em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>They will hang Jeff Davis to a tree, (x3)<br>
As they march along.<br>
<em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>Now three rousing cheers for the Union! (x3)<br>
As we are marching on!<br>
<em>Chorus</em></p>
<h2>Battle Hymn of the Republic</h2>
<p>Text: Julia Ward Howe, 1862<br>
(Original third verse)</p>
<p>I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel:<br>
As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;<br>
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,<br>
Since God is marching on.</p>
