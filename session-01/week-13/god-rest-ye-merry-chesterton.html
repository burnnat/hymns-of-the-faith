		<h1 class="title">Week 13: God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen</h1>
	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>Text: G. K. Chesterton, 1922</p>
<p>God rest you merry gentlemen,<br>
Let nothing you dismay;<br>
The Herald Angels cannot sing,<br>
The cops arrest them on the wing,<br>
And warn them of the docketing<br>
Of anything they say.</p>
<p>God rest you merry gentlemen,<br>
May nothing you dismay:<br>
On your reposeful cities lie<br>
Deep silence, broken only by<br>
The motor-horn’s melodious cry,<br>
The hooter’s happy bray.</p>
<p>So, when the song of children ceased,<br>
And Herod was obeyed,<br>
In his high hall Corinthian<br>
With purple and with peacock fan,<br>
Rested that merry gentleman;<br>
And nothing him dismayed.</p>
