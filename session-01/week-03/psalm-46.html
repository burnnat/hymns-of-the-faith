		<h3 class="subtitle">English Standard Version</h1>
	<div class="main-wrapper">
		<p>1 God is our refuge and strength,<br>
a very present help in trouble.<br>
2 Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,<br>
though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,<br>
3 though its waters roar and foam,<br>
though the mountains tremble at its swelling.</p>
<p>4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,<br>
the holy habitation of the Most High.<br>
5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;<br>
God will help her when morning dawns.<br>
6 The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;<br>
he utters his voice, the earth melts.<br>
7 The Lord of hosts is with us;<br>
the God of Jacob is our fortress.</p>
<p>8 Come, behold the works of the Lord,<br>
how he has brought desolations on the earth.<br>
9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;<br>
he breaks the bow and shatters the spear;<br>
he burns the chariots with fire.<br>
10 “Be still, and know that I am God.<br>
I will be exalted among the nations,<br>
I will be exalted in the earth!”<br>
11 The Lord of hosts is with us;<br>
the God of Jacob is our fortress.</p>
