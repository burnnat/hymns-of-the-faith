## {{{hymn "How Firm A Foundation" id="how_firm_a_foundation_ye_saints_of"}}}

Text: {{person "Anonymous"}}, 1787
 - Published in {{{book "A Selection of Hymns from the Best Authors, Intended As an Appendix to Dr. Watts's Psalms and Hymns"}}} by {{person "John Rippon"}}, with the author only indicated as "K--"
 - Most scholars believe this refers to {{person "Richard Keen"}}, music director in the London church where Rippon was pastor
 - The hymn was almost instantly popular, especially in America where it was re-published just three years later

Tune: {{person "Anonymous"}}, 1832
 - First included in {{{book "A Compilation of Genuine Church Music"}}} by {{person "Joseph Funk"}} and later in {{{book "Southern Harmony"}}} and {{{book "The Sacred Harp"}}}
 - Funk was born in Lancaster County, PA, into a German Mennonite family that moved to the Shenandoah Valley, VA, soon after
 - Working as both a farmer and schoolteacher, Funk published music collections on the side and his {{{book "Compilation"}}} is in its 24th revision and still in use by Mennonites today
 - Although originally listed as {{{caps "Protection"}}}, then {{{caps "Sincerity"}}} and {{{caps "Solicitude"}}}, the tune is now known as {{{caps "Foundation"}}}
 - Also sometimes sung to {{{caps "Adeste Fideles"}}} (tune for "O Come All Ye Faithful")

1. Fittingly for a hymn about scripture, the text quotes a number of bible verses off the bat, including {{{verse "Isaiah 41:10"}}}, {{{verse "Isaiah 43:2"}}}, {{{verse "Deuteronomy 31:6"}}}, and {{{verse "Hebrews 13:5"}}}. How closely does the hymn text follow these passages?

2. What rhetorical devices do you see used in the text that help keep it strong and memorable?

## Exercises

1. As a class, brainstorm potential topics to use in writing a hymn together. Consider the following questions to generate ideas:

	- What advice would you give to a new Christian, from experience in your own faith journey?
	- What unique challenges does the church face today (both locally and globally)?
	- What lessons or ideas do you think are often underappreciated by other Christians?
	- What occasions or themes does the church currently lack quality music for?
