{{~#line "0" "1"}}Lord, you have been our dwelling place{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}in all generations.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "2"}}Before the mountains were brought forth,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}or ever you had formed the earth and the world,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}from everlasting to everlasting you are God.{{/line~}}
</p><p>
{{~#line "0" "3"}}You return man to dust{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}and say, “Return, O children of man!”{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "4"}}For a thousand years in your sight{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}are but as yesterday when it is past,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}or as a watch in the night.{{/line~}}
</p><p>
{{~#line "0" "5"}}You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}like grass that is renewed in the morning:{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "6"}}in the morning it flourishes and is renewed;{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}in the evening it fades and withers.{{/line~}}
</p><p>
{{~#line "0" "7"}}For we are brought to an end by your anger;{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}by your wrath we are dismayed.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "8"}}You have set our iniquities before you,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}our secret sins in the light of your presence.{{/line~}}
</p><p>
{{~#line "0" "9"}}For all our days pass away under your wrath;{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}we bring our years to an end like a sigh.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "10"}}The years of our life are seventy,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}or even by reason of strength eighty;{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0"}}yet their span is but toil and trouble;{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}they are soon gone, and we fly away.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "11"}}Who considers the power of your anger,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}and your wrath according to the fear of you?{{/line~}}
</p><p>
{{~#line "0" "12"}}So teach us to number our days{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}that we may get a heart of wisdom.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "13"}}Return, O Lord! How long?{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}Have pity on your servants!{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "14"}}Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "15"}}Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}and for as many years as we have seen evil.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "16"}}Let your work be shown to your servants,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}and your glorious power to their children.{{/line~}}
{{~#line "0" "17"}}Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us,{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}and establish the work of our hands upon us;{{/line~}}
{{~#line "1"}}yes, establish the work of our hands!{{/line~}}
