O Christian church across the globe,
who in God's word unite,
although from lands so far away
still glimpse His guiding light,
whom Christ has taken as His bride,
all nations to give praise;
in all the ways you serve the Lord
join all your hands to raise.

...
in unity abide;
may love and joy within our hearts
put all our sins aside.

...
who in God's word unite,
although from lands so far away
yet still can see Your light,

...
whom God has blessed as sage,
the Bride of Christ, his very own,
all sexes, race, and age

...
make unity your aim;
although you may not think alike,
still love alike the same.

...
let us all come to Christ;
be one in mind and heart and soul,
and ever seek His trust.

...
all nations to give praise;
in all the ways we praise the Lord
give all our hands to raise.
