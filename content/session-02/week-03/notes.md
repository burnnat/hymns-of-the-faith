## {{{hymn "Now Thank We All Our God" id="now_thank_we_all_our_god"}}}

Text: Martin Rinkart (1586–1649), 1636
 - Son of a German cooper, received a scholarship to study theology at the University of Leipzig
 - Passed over for a clerical appointment to his hometown, found work elsewhere as a teacher and minister
{{#if notes}}
    - Ostensibly, the superintendent felt he was a better musician than theologian, but he likely feared being undermined by a headstrong young man with support in the community
{{/if}}
 - Finally invited back to serve in his hometown, Eilenburg, by its town council in 1617
 - Onset of the Thirty Years War soon after inundated the walled city of Eilenburg with displaced refugees
 - With them was brought famine and plague, with Rinkart often performing between 40-50 funerals in a day
 - For a time the only clergy in Eilenburg, the combination of his charity and writing soon wore him out
 - Rinkart's text "Nun danket alle Gott" was written right in the middle of the war

Tune: Johann Crüger (1598–1662), 1647
 - Born near Brandenburg, Germany, left home to study both music and theology
 - From 1622 to his death, worked simultaneously as a teacher and cantor (choirmaster) in Berlin
 - In 1636, lost his wife and several children to the plague, almost dying himself
 - Remarried shortly thereafter and went on to have fourteen more children
 - Edited and published {{{book "Praxis pietatis melica"}}} in 1647, the most widespread Lutheran hymnal of the 17th century

	- Originally intended for use prior to mealtime
	- Similarly to "All Praise to Thee" from last week, the last verse is a doxology
		- In this case, the text is a fairly straightforward translation of the "Gloria Patri" from the Latin mass
