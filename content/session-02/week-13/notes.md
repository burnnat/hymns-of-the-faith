## {{{hymn "Christ, From Whom All Blessings Flow" id="christ_from_whom_all_blessings_flow_perf"}}}

Text: Charles Wesley (1707–1788), 1740
 - Originally the fourth part of a six-part poem "The Communion of Saints"
 - This epic poem totaled 39 stanzas of eight lines each, equivalent to 78 stanzas of common meter
 - Published in the second edition of the Wesleys' {{{book "Hymns and Sacred Poems"}}}

Tune: Orlando Gibbons (1583–1625), 1623
 - Born in Oxford, England, son of a wait (town piper employed by the local government)
 - Appointed senior organist at the Chapel Royal by King James I, later at Westminster Abbey
 - Also played keyboards in the court of King Charles I (Prince Charles at the time)
 - Died suddenly at age 41, leading to rumors he died of the black plague (autopsy revealed this to be untrue)
 - Considered one of the finest composers of his generation, best known for his keyboard works
 - Composed this tune for a text from the Song of Songs, published as the thirteenth hymn in {{{book "Hymnes and Songs of the Church"}}} by George Withers, leading to its common name of {{{caps "Song 13"}}}
 - Some hymnals refer to the tune by the name {{{caps "Canterbury"}}} instead, the place of Gibbons' death and burial

1. Wesley is known for (among other things) the scriptural content of his hymns. This hymn also quotes some non-biblical sources as well. What references can you find?

	- {{{verse "1 Corinthians 12"}}} talks about spiritual gifts and one-body-many-members
	- {{{verse "Ephesians 4"}}} talks about unity ("one Lord, one faith, one baptism")
	- {{{verse "Galatians 3:27-28"}}} talks about ending divisions ("there is neither Jew nor Greek" ...)
	- Opening line comes from Thomas Ken's "All Praise to Thee, My God, This Night", which gave us our doxology
	- Final three lines of the opening match portions of the {{{bok "Book of Common Prayer"}}}
	- Final verse paraphrases a poem by Matthew Prior, {{{book "Solomon"}}}, saying:

	  > Or grant Thy passion has these names destroy'd
	  > that Love, like Death, makes all distinctions boid.

2. What unique features of this hymn make it memorable and meaningful? How well are these techniques executed?

	- Literary devices:
		- Epanalepsis: "Join us, in one spirit, join"
		- Repetition: The "all in all" is used first for the completeness of Christ's fulfillment, then as a title for God

	- In the first line, "perfecting" has syllables mismatched with the "natural" flow of the camper.

## Exercises

1. Use the thoughts and ideas from last week to write a first verse focusing on church unity at the "world-wide" scale. Use CMD (8.6.8.6D) and this opening line as a starting point: "O Christian church across the globe..."
