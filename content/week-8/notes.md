## O Love, How Deep, How Broad, How High

Text: Thomas à Kempis (1380–1471), 1854
 - Son of a German blacksmith, attended Latin school as a child
 - At the age of 20, entered the Monastery of Mount St. Agnes, and was fully ordained at 33
 - He wrote countless meditations, sermons, poems, and prayers, four biographies of monastery members, as well as copied the Bible no fewer than four times, but is most famous for his book {{{book "The Imitation of Christ"}}} (which would later influence the conversion of John Newton)
 - The original text “O amor quam ecstaticus” was excerpted from twenty-three stanzas in Latin
 - Benjamin Webb, a British pastor, provided the English translation which was first published by his friend John Mason Neale in {{{book "The Hymnal Noted"}}} in 1854

Tune: Traditional English, 1906
 - Originally written in the 15th century to commemorate the 1415 victory of England’s Henry V in the Battle of Agincourt, as part of the Hundred Years’ War
 - The tune name {{{caps "Deo Gracias"}}} comes from the Latin refrain in the original lyrics:
	> Our kyng went forth to normandy
	> Wyth grace and myth of chyvalry
	> Þer god for hym wrouth mervelowsly
	> Qwerfore ynglond may cal and cry
	> Deo gracias! Deo gracias anglia redde pro victoria!
 - First adapted into a hymn tune in 1906 by omitting the refrain

1. The hymn is a whirlwind tour of Jesus’ life, from birth to death and resurrection, held together by little more than the repeated phrase “for us”. Some of these connections are more intuitive than others, however. In what way was Christ baptized “for us”? How was His temptation “for us”?
{{#if notes}}
	- Regarding Jesus’ baptism:
		- Jesus was baptized as an example for us to do the same and, although he had no need for baptism ({{{verse "Matthew 3:13-15"}}}), was identifying Himself with sinners; baptism is not a *means* to repentance, but rather a *symbol* of it
		- Jesus’ divinity was publicly displayed at His baptism ({{{verse "Luke 3:21-22"}}})
		- Jesus’ baptism showed the world the messianic era had begun (like the dove for Noah, the dove descending on Jesus symbolizes the end of God’s wrath and a new peace)
		- Jesus’ baptism was part of his sacrifice; for Israelites, on the Day of Atonement, the High Priest was washed in water before performing the sacrifice ({{{verse "Leviticus 16:4"}}})
		- The dove was the only bird allowed for ritual sacrifice, and usually reserved for the poorest members of society; by extension, Jesus’ sacrifice is for the poorest of us
	- Regarding Jesus’ temptation:
		- Jesus’ sinlessness was necessary for our salvation; by resisting temptation he was qualified as the perfect sacrifice, blameless Lamb of God ({{{verse "Hebrews 2:17-18"}}})
		- Jesus’ third temptation was that of an “easy way out”, offered rule of kingdoms on earth without the need for sacrifice or suffering ({{{verse "Matthew 4:8-9"}}}); his rejection was a selfless gift affirming His sacrifice for our sake

## All Glory, Laud, and Honor

Text: Theodulf of Orléans (c. 750–821), 1854
 - Appointed Archbishop of Orleans by Charlemagne in 781
 - In 817, Charlemagne’s successor Louis the Pious accused him of treason and had him imprisoned
 - This text, thirty-nine couplets in Latin, was written around 820 during his imprisonment
 - Legend has it that as the King visited Angers where Theodulf was imprisoned, he heard this hymn being sung and was so moved, when he found that Theodulf was the singer he ordered his release
 - Regardless of the reason, Theodulf was released in 821, but died that year, rumored to be a poisoning
 - This text was translated twice into English by John Mason Neale; “All Glory, Laud, and Honor” (originally “Glory, and Laud, and Honor”) became the more popular, also published in {{{book "The Hymnal Noted"}}} in 1854
 - A prominent member of the Oxford Movement, Neale is unparalleled in translations of Latin and Greek hymns, whose works include: “Come, Ye Faithful, Raise the Strain”, “Good Christian Men Rejoice”, “Good King Wenceslas”, “O come, O come, Emmanuel”, “Of the Father's Love Begotten”, and others

Tune: Melchior Teschner (1584–1635), 1615
 - Little is known of Teschner’s life, other than his studies of philosophy, theology, and music at the University of Frankfurt, and his work as cantor and pastor of churches in Fraustadt and Oberpritschen
 - Provided tunes for many German hymns; for this reason the tune {{{caps "St. Theodulph"}}} is also known as {{{caps "Valet Will Ich Dir Geben"}}}, title of the original German text it accompanied
 - Johann Sebastian Bach provided a harmonization of the tune for use in his “St. John Passion”
 - The harmonization here was written for {{{book "Hymns Ancient and Modern"}}} in 1861 by William H. Monk (composer of {{{caps "Eventide"}}}, tune for “Abide With Me”)

1. This text is specifically for Palm Sunday, dealing with Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It connects our own praise with the praise of the Hebrews, and in the last verse asks God to accept our prayers just as he accepted the praise in Jerusalem. Why do we need to ask God to accept our praise? How is our praise today like the praises of the palm wavers in Jerusalem?
{{#if notes}}
	- We are imperfect humans and our praise is fickle. The same crowd shouting “Hosanna!” would be shouting “Crucify him!” just a few days later.
	- Our praise is laced with our own selfish desires; “hosanna” is a shout of joy but literally means “save us”, underscoring the Hebrews’ desire for a military and political savior from the Romans
	- Strictly speaking, God doesn’t need our praise - it’s a gift. Jesus said even if the crowds were silent, the stones would cry out in praise. ({{{verse "Luke 19:40"}}})
