Text: Phillips Brooks, 1868
(Original fourth verse)

Where children pure and happy,
Pray to the blessed child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;*
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

*In drafts, “Son of the Undefiled”
