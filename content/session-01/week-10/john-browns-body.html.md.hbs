## John Brown's Body
Text: Traditional American, 1861

John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave, (x3)
His soul is marching on.

*Chorus:*
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
His soul is marching on.

He’s gone to be a soldier in the Army of the Lord, (x3)
His soul is marching on.
*Chorus*

John Brown’s knapsack is strapped upon his back, (x3)
His soul is marching on.
*Chorus*

His pet lambs will meet him on the way, (x3)
They go marching on.
*Chorus*

They will hang Jeff Davis to a tree, (x3)
As they march along.
*Chorus*

Now three rousing cheers for the Union! (x3)
As we are marching on!
*Chorus*

## Battle Hymn of the Republic
Text: Julia Ward Howe, 1862
(Original third verse)

I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel:
As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,
Since God is marching on.
