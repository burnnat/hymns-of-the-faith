## Kenosis Hymn

Philippians 2:6-11, one of the earliest Christian hymns, written ca. AD 50.

ὃς ἐν μορφῇ θεοῦ ὑπάρχων
οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο τὸ εἶναι ἴσα θεῷ,
> Who, though he was in the form of God,
> did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,

ἀλλὰ ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσεν
μορφὴν δούλου λαβών,
> but emptied himself,
> by taking the form of a servant,

ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπων γενόμενος·
καὶ σχήματι εὑρεθεὶς ὡς ἄνθρωπος
> being born in the likeness of men.
> And being found in human form,

ἐταπείνωσεν ἑαυτὸν
γενόμενος ὑπήκοος μέχρι θανάτου, θανάτου δὲ σταυροῦ·
> he humbled himself
> by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.

διὸ καὶ ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ὑπερύψωσεν,
καὶ ἐχαρίσατο αὐτῷ τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ὑπὲρ πᾶν ὄνομα,
> Therefore God has highly exalted him
> and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,

ἵνα ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ πᾶν γόνυ κάμψῃ
ἐπουρανίων καὶ ἐπιγείων καὶ καταχθονίων,
> so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
> in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

καὶ πᾶσα γλῶσσα ἐξομολογήσηται ὅτι κύριος Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸ
εἰς δόξαν θεοῦ πατρός.
> and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
> to the glory of God the Father.

## Phos Hilaron

Oldest known Christian hymn with music, written ca. AD 300.

Φῶς ἱλαρὸν ἁγίας δόξης ἀθανάτου Πατρός,
οὐρανίου, ἁγίου, μάκαρος, Ἰησοῦ Χριστέ,
> O Light gladsome of the holy glory of the Immortal Father,
> the Heavenly, the Holy, the Blessed, O Jesus Christ,

ἐλθόντες ἐπὶ τὴν ἡλίου δύσιν, ἰδόντες φῶς ἑσπερινόν,
ὑμνοῦμεν Πατέρα, Υἱόν, καὶ ἅγιον Πνεῦμα, Θεόν.
> having come upon the setting of the sun, having seen the light of the evening,
> we praise the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit: God.

Ἄξιόν σε ἐν πᾶσι καιροῖς ὑμνεῖσθαι φωναῖς αἰσίαις,
Υἱὲ Θεοῦ, ζωὴν ὁ διδούς· διὸ ὁ κόσμος σὲ δοξάζει.
> Worthy it is at all times to praise Thee in joyful voices,
> O Son of God, Giver of Life, for which the world glorifies Thee.

## Cædmon’s Hymn

Earliest known hymn in English, written ca. AD 670.

Nu we sculon herigean heofonrices weard,
meotodes meahte and his modgeþanc,
weorc wuldorfæder, swa he wundra gehwæs,
ece drihten, or onstealde.
> Now we must praise the Protector of the heavenly kingdom,
> the might of the Measurer and His mind's purpose,
> the work of the Father of Glory, as He for each of the wonders,
> the eternal Lord, established a beginning.

He ærest sceop eorðan bearnum
heofon to hrofe, halig scyppend;
þa middangeard moncynnes weard,
ece drihten, æfter teode
firum foldan, frea ælmihtig.
> He shaped first for the sons of the Earth
> heaven as a roof, the Holy Maker;
> then the Middle-World, mankind's Guardian,
> the eternal Lord, made afterwards,
> solid ground for men, the almighty Lord.
