Text: Albert Midlane, 1862

Sinner, where is room for doubting?
Has not Jesus died for sin?
Did He not in resurrection
Victory over Satan win?

Hear Him on the cross exclaiming —
“It is finish’d,” ere He died;
See Him in His mercy saving,
One there hanging by His side.

’Twas for sinners that He suffer’d
Agonies unspeakable;
Canst thou doubt thou art a sinner?
If thou canst — then hope farewell.

But, believing what is written —
“All are guilty” — “dead in sin,”
Looking to the Crucified One
Hope shall rise thy soul within.

Hope and peace, and joy unfailing,
Through the Saviour’s precious blood,
All thy crimson sins forgiven,
And thy soul brought nigh to God.
