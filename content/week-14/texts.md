Hark how all the Welkin rings
“Glory to the King of Kings,
Peace on Earth, and Mercy mild,
God and Sinners reconcil’d!”

Joyful all ye Nations rise,
Join the Triumph of the Skies;
Universal Nature say,
“Christ the Lord is born to Day!”

Christ, by highest Heav’n ador’d,
Christ, the Everlasting Lord,
Late in Time behold him come,
Offspring of a Virgin's Womb.

Veil’d in Flesh, the Godhead see,
Hail th’ Incarnate Deity!
Pleas’d as Man with Men t’appear,
Jesus, our Immanuel here!

Hail the Heav’nly Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and Life to All he brings,
Ris’n with Healing in his Wings.

Mild he lays his Glory by;
Born; that Man no more may die,
Born; to raise the Sons of Earth,
Born; to give them Second Birth.

Come, Desire of Nations, come,
Fix in Us thy humble Home,
Rise, the Woman's Conqu'ring Seed,
Bruise in Us the Serpent's Head.

Now display thy saving Pow’r,
Ruin’d Nature now restore,
Now in Mystic Union join
Thine to Ours, and Ours to Thine.

Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface,
Stamp thy Image in its Place,
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in thy Love.

Let us Thee, tho’ lost, regain,
Thee, the Life, the Heav’nly Man:
O! to All Thyself impart,
Form’d in each Believing Heart.

Of the Father sole begotten,
Ere the worlds began to be,
He the Alpha and Omega,
He the source, the ending he,
Of the things that are, that have been,
And that future years shall see,
Evermore and evermore.

He is here, whom seers in old time
Chaunted of, while ages ran;
Whom the writings of the Prophets
Promised since the world began:
Then foretold, now manifested,
To receive the praise of man,
Evermore and evermore.

O that ever-blessed birthday,
When the Virgin, full of grace,
Of the Holy Ghost incarnate
Bare the Saviour of our race;
And that Child, the world’s Redeemer,
First display’d his sacred face,
Evermore and evermore.

Praise him, O ye Heavens of Heavens!
Praise him, Angels in the height
Every Power and every Virtue
Sing the praise of God aright:
Let no tongue of man be silent,
Let each heart and voice unite,
Evermore and evermore.

Thee let age, and thee let manhood,
Thee let quires of infants sing;
Thee the matrons and the virgins,
And the children answering:
Let their modest song re-echo,
And their heart its praises bring,
Evermore and evermore.

Laud and honour to the Father,
Laud and honour to the Son,
Laud and honour to the Spirit,
Ever Three and ever One:
Consubstantial, Co-eternal,
While unending ages run,
Evermore and evermore.
