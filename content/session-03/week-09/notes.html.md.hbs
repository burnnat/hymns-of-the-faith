## {{{hymn "Ah, Holy Jesus" id="ah_holy_jesus_how_hast_thou_offended"}}}

Text: {{person "Johann Heermann"}} (1585–1657), 1630
 - Eldest surviving child in a German Lutheran family, born in Silesia, part of modern-day Poland
 - Studied under a variety of tutors between intermittent bouts of severe illness
 - Eventually employed as a private tutor for the son of theologian Valerius Herberger, who recognized Heermann's poetic talent and encouraged him to publish and study at university
 - Studies cut short by more health issues, in 1611 he returned home and was appointed deacon to a nearby church in Köben whose pastor was old and infirm
 - A week after beginning work, the pastor died and Heermann took over as interim pastor for the congregation, then made permanent shortly after and remained there for over 20 years
 - During his tenure, he saw the town hit by the black plague, a massive fire, and ransacking during the Thirty Years' War, in addition to the death of his wife, loss of possessions, and continued ill spells
 - While his early poetry was in Latin, this text is from a later collection of German devotional poems titled {{book "Devoti musica cordis"}}
 - Originally 15 verses, it was based on a Latin meditation written by {{person "John of Fécamp"}}, an abbot in Normandy in the 11th century (though sometimes attributed to St. Augustine)
 - This translation into English is by {{person "Robert Bridges"}} in 1897, though one by {{person "Catherine Winkworth"}} ("O dearest Jesus, what law hast Thou broken") is also popular

Tune: {{person "Johann Crüger"}} (1598–1662), 1640
 - Son of an innkeeper, born in Groß Breesen, which today is directly on the German-Polish border
 - Studied both music and theology, first in Berlin and then later at the University of Wittenberg
 - Worked first as a tutor, then as a schoolteacher and choirmaster at the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas' Church, founded around AD 1220, the oldest in Berlin)
 - Also known as composer of the chorale tune for "Now Thank We All Our God", and edited a number of influential Lutheran hymnals
 - This tune {{caps "Herzliebster Jesu"}} comes from his first edited hymnal, containing 248 hymns total
 - Later popularized by {{person "Johann Sebastian Bach"}} who used it three times in his "St. Matthew Passion" and twice in the "St. John Passion"

## {{{hymn "I Cannot Tell" id="i_cannot_tell_why_he_whom_angels_worship"}}}

Text: {{person "William Young Fullerton"}} (1857–1932), 1920
 - Born in Belfast, Ireland, influenced as a young adult by the preaching of English Baptist {{person "Charles Spurgeon"}}
 - Spurgeon later became a friend and mentor, and Fullerton helped prepare Spurgeon's manuscripts for publication
 - Prominent in the Baptist church, Fullerton compiled hymnals and wrote a number of books in addition to serving as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, and later president of the Baptist Union
 - Better known for his biographies (of Spurgeon, {{person "John Bunyan"}}, and others), this is his only hymn in common use

Tune: {{person "Traditional Irish" name="Traditional"}}
 - An Irish folk tune, its name {{caps "Londonderry Air"}} comes from the Irish county where it was first collected by one {{person "Jane Ross"}}
 - Since no other folk tune collectors had recorded the tune independently, scholars believe Ross was fooled by the use of rubato and mistakenly transcribed the tune in 4/4 rather than 3/4 time
 - If that is true, the tune appears to be a derivative of a much older tune "Aisling an Óigfhir"
 - Most will recognize the tune as commonly used with the lyrics "O Danny Boy", written in 1910
 - Other hymns using this tune include texts written by {{person "Timothy Dudley-Smith"}}, {{person "Kristyn Getty"}}, and more

 - Crossman later renounced Puritan theology and in 1665 was reinstated to a chaplaincy in Bristol
