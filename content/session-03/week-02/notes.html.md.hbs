 - Ordained in 1847 and served as King's College chaplain until 1868

Tune: William Croft (1678–1727), 1708
 - Born to a prominent, wealthy family in Ettington, England, near Stratford-upon-Avon
 - Educated in the Chapel Royal under baroque composer John Blow (whose other students included Jeremiah Clarke and Henry Purcell)
{{#if notes}}
	- While the others (especially Purcell) became successful secular composers, nearly all of Croft's music is sacred in nature
{{/if}}
 - Became organist at St. Anne's Church in 1700 and later organist of Westminster Abbey in 1709 after the death of Blow
 - In 1724, published his "Musica Sacra", a two-volume collection of church music, and the first of its kind to be printed in "score format"
{{#if notes}}
	- Previously, common practice was to present the text in verse form, with the tune separate.
{{/if}}
 - His best known tune may be {{{caps "St. Anne"}}} (tune for "O God Our Help in Ages Past")

1. What is this hymn's answer to the "problem of pain"? Can you summarize it in a single sentence?
{{#if notes}}
	- Note emphasis on the acts of Jesus referenced throughout ("he's done it before, he'll do it again")
	- Not just "Lord of Life", Jesus is "Lord of Life and Death" through resurrection
{{/if}}

2. Re-read the third verse. This verse is ommitted from basically every modern hymnal - can you guess why? What are your thoughts?
{{#if notes}}
	- Opening could seem to suggest that miracles are no longer possible
	- Interesting on "those who do Thy work" ... doctors perhaps?

Text: Thomas Moore (1779–1852), 1816

 - Of all his poetry, only one collection - his "Sacred Songs" of 1816, 32 poems in total - were spiritual in nature
 - Thomas Hastings substantially modified Moore's original version for inclusion in {{{book "Spiritual Songs for Social Worship"}}}, which he co-edited with Lowell Mason in 1831

{{/if}}

Tune: Samuel Webbe (1740–1816), 1790
 - His father died when he was an infant, raised by his mother alone in London

 - This tune, {{{caps "Consolator"}}} was chosen by Hastings and Mason to accompany the text

{{/if}}

2. Of the three hymns today, "Come, Ye Disconsolate" is by far the most widespread. Why do you think that is?
