	{{#translation "Literal Translation"}}
		I arise today
		through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,
		through belief in the threeness,
		through confession of the oneness
		of the Creator of creation.

		I arise today
		through the strength of Christ with His baptism,
		through the strength of His crucifixion with His burial,
		through the strength of His resurrection with His ascension,
		through the strength of His descent for the Judgment of Doom.

		I arise today
		through the strength of the love of Cherubim,
		in obedience of angels,
		in the service of the archangels,
		in hope of resurrection to meet with reward,
		in prayers of Patriarchs,
		in predictions of Prophets,
		in preachings of Apostles,
		in faiths of Confessors,
		in innocence of holy Virgins,
		in deeds of righteous men.

		I arise today
		through the strength of heaven:
		light of sun,
		brilliance of moon,
		splendour of fire,
		speed of lightning,
		swiftness of wind,
		depth of sea,
		stability of earth,
		firmness of rock.

		I arise today
		through God's strength to pilot me:
		God's might to uphold me,
		God's wisdom to guide me,
		God's eye to look before me,
		God's ear to hear me,
		God's word to speak for me,
		God's hand to guard me,
		God's way to lie before me,
		God's shield to protect me,
		God's host to secure me,
		against snares of devils,
		against temptations of vices,
		against inclinations of nature,
		against every one who shall wish me ill,
		afar and near,
		alone and in a multitude.

		I summon today all those powers between me (and these evils),
		against every cruel merciless power that may oppose my body and my soul,
		against incantations of false prophets,
		against black laws of heathenry,
		against false laws of heretics,
		against craft of idolatry,
		against spells of women and smiths and druids,
		against every knowledge that binds man’s body and soul.

		Christ protect me today
		against poison, against burning,
		against drowning, against wounding,
		so that there may come to me abundance of reward.

		Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me,
		Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me,
		Christ on my right, Christ on my left.
		Christ in breadth, Christ in length, Christ in height.
		Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,
		Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,
		Christ in every eye that sees me,
		Christ in every ear that hears me.

		I arise today
		through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,
		through belief in the threeness,
		through confession of the oneness,
		of the Creator of creation.
