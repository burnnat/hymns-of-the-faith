Text: Rabanus Maurus, ca. AD 800

Veni, Creator Spiritus,
mentes tuorum visita,
imple superna gratia
quae tu creasti pectora.
> Come, creator Spirit,
> visit the souls of your own,
> fill with heavenly grace
> the breasts that you have created.

Qui diceris Paraclitus,
altissimi donum Dei,
fons vivus, ignis, caritas,
et spiritalis unctio.
> You are called Paraclete,
> gift of the most high God,
> living water, flame, charity,
> and spiritual anointing.

Tu, septiformis munere,
digitus paternae dexterae,
Tu rite promissum Patris,
sermone ditans guttura.
> You, who are sevenfold in your gifts,
> finger of God's right hand,
> you who were rightly promised by the Father,
> enrich our throats with speech.

Accende lumen sensibus,
infunde amorem cordibus;
infirma nostri corporis
virtute firmans perpeti.
> Inflame the light of our senses,
> pour love into our hearts;
> the weakness of our bodies
> strengthen with lasting power.

Hostem repellas longius,
pacemque dones protinus:
ductore sic te praevio
vitemus omne noxium.
> Drive the enemy far back,
> and at once grant us peace:
> with you going ahead of us,
> may we avoid all harm.

Per te sciamus da Patrem,
noscamus atque Filium;
Teque utriusque Spiritum
credamus omni tempore.
> Through you may we know the Father,
> and recognize the Son;
> and may we always believe in you,
> Spirit of both.

Deo Patri sit gloria,
et Filio, qui a mortuis
surrexit, ac Paraclito,
in saeculorum saecula.
> To God the Father be glory,
> and to the Son, who from death
> rose again, and to the Holy Spirit,
> forever and ever.
