		Veni, Creator Spiritus,
		mentes tuorum visita,
		imple superna gratia
		quae tu creasti pectora.

		Qui diceris Paraclitus,
		altissimi donum Dei,
		fons vivus, ignis, caritas,
		et spiritalis unctio.

		Tu, septiformis munere,
		digitus paternae dexterae,
		Tu rite promissum Patris,
		sermone ditans guttura.

		Accende lumen sensibus,
		infunde amorem cordibus;
		infirma nostri corporis
		virtute firmans perpeti.

		Hostem repellas longius,
		pacemque dones protinus:
		ductore sic te praevio
		vitemus omne noxium.

		Per te sciamus da Patrem,
		noscamus atque Filium;
		Teque utriusque Spiritum
		credamus omni tempore.

		Deo Patri sit gloria,
		et Filio, qui a mortuis
		surrexit, ac Paraclito,
		in saeculorum saecula.

		Come, creator Spirit,
		visit the souls of your own,
		fill with heavenly grace
		the breasts that you have created.

		You are called Paraclete,
		gift of the most high God,
		living water, flame, charity,
		and spiritual anointing.

		You, who are sevenfold in your gifts,
		finger of God's right hand,
		you who were rightly promised by the Father,
		enrich our throats with speech.

		Inflame the light of our senses,
		pour love into our hearts;
		the weakness of our bodies
		strengthen with lasting power.

		Drive the enemy far back,
		and at once grant us peace:
		with you going ahead of us,
		may we avoid all harm.

		Through you may we know the Father,
		and recognize the Son;
		and may we always believe in you,
		Spirit of both.

		To God the Father be glory,
		and to the Son, who from death
		rose again, and to the Holy Spirit,
		forever and ever.
