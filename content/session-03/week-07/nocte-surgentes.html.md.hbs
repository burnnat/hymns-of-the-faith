Text: Pope Gregory I, ca. AD 600

Nocte surgentes vigilemus omnes,
semper in psalmis meditemur atque
viribus totis Domino canamus
dulciter hymnos,
> In the night, rising, let us keep vigil everyone,
> at all times in psalms let us meditate and
> with all our strength to the Lord let us sing
> sweetly, hymns,

Ut, pio regi pariter canentes
cum suis sanctis mereamur aulam
ingredi caeli, simul et beatam
ducere vitam.
> That, to the Holy King together singing,
> with His saints may we merit the hall
> of heaven to enter, and likewise a blessed
> life to lead.

Praestet hoc nobis Deitas beata
Patris ac Nati, pariterque Sancti
Spiritus, cuius resonat per omnem
gloria mundum. Amen.
> May He grant this to us, the Deity Blessed
> of Father and of Son, and equally of Holy
> Spirit, of whose glory resonates throughout all
> the world. Amen.
