## {{{hymn "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" id="joyful_joyful_we_adore_thee"}}}

 - Son of a Presbyterian minister from Brooklyn known post-civil-war for anti-abolitionist writings

 - Friends with Woodrow Wilson, a Princeton classmate, who appointed him ambassdador to the Netherlands and Luxembourg just before World War I
 - Specifically wrote this text (titled "Hymn of Joy") to accompany Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" melody
 - Van Dyke wrote this description of the hymn text:
   > These verses are simple expressions of common Christian feelings and desires in this present time — hymns of today that may be sung together by people who know the thought of the age, and are not afraid that any truth of science will destroy religion, or any revolution on earth overthrow the kingdom of heaven. Therefore this is a hymn of trust and joy and hope.

Tune: {{person "Ludwig van Beethoven"}} (1770–1827), 1824
 - Born in Bonn, Germany, following two generations of musicians, and demonstrated talent at an early age
 - Hoping to replicate Mozart's success as a child prodigy, his father pushed him in string musical study and traveling performances
 - Following the death of his mother at age 17 and his father's fall into alcoholism, took responsibility of his two younger brothers
 - Arranged to study with {{person "Joseph Haydn"}} in Vienna in 1792, after the two met when Haydn was en route to London
 - Began to suffer from hearing loss in 1798, causing him to stop all public performing after 1811 until directing the premiere of his Ninth Symphony
 - Best known for his piano sonatas, string quartets, orchestral concertos, and nine symphonies
 - This tune was written to accompany {{person "Friedrich Schiller"}}'s poem "Ode to Joy" which he wrote as a "celebration of the brotherhood of man"
 - It was later adopted as the official anthem of the European Union

1. How does the hymn text explore the idea of "joy" without being shallow or naive? What are some of the reasons it gives to be joyful?
{{#if notes}}
	- Verse 3 explores some contrasting, paradoxical ideas that give the hymn meaningful depth:
		- Relationship between "giving" and "forgiving"
		- Joy in both life and death
		- God as both "father" and "brother"
	- Explores different reasons for joy:
		- God's inward transformation, driving out doubt, sin, and sadness
		- God's wonderful creation reflecting God's goodness
		- Human love for one another inspired by God's love for us
{{/if}}

2. How well do the text and tune fit together, and why?
{{#if notes}}
	- The meter 8.7.8.7D is similar to Common Meter Double, not infrequently used
		- Other famous texts in the same meter are "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing", "Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah", "Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus", etc.
	- The tied pickup into the third phrase is source of some debate - whether to remain true to Beethoven's original version or "sanitize" it for easier congregational singing
	- Both Van Dyke's "Joyful, Joyful" and Schiller's "Ode to Joy" share similar themes which match the upbeat melody

 - Originally wrote the music for his orchestra suite "The Planets", in the central movement "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity"
{{#if notes}}
 - Holst did not consider "The Planets" to be one of his finer works, and was somewhat disappointed to see it overshadow what he considered better pieces, though of the movements he conisdered "Saturn" his favorite
 - He was not a fan of performances that only included some of the movements, and was particularly displeased at those ending with "Jupiter", saying "in the real world the end is not happy at all"
{{/if}}

1. Rarely used outside of Great Britain, even there the hymn has fallen out of favor in some circles because of its equivalence between loyalty to nation and loyalty to God. Do you think this criticism is appropriate, and why or why not?
{{#if notes}}
	- Rev. Dr. Gordon Giles, an Anglican vicar and editor of the {{book "Ancient and Modern"}} hymnal, [has written](https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2013/8-november/comment/opinion/can-i-vow-to-thee-be-renovated):
		> The notion of "vowing" everything to a country, including the sacrifice of one's life for the glorification of nationhood, challenges sensibilities today. The idea relies on a dated military concept of fighting for "King and Country"... In post-colonial Britain, this comes across as patronising and unjust... Should we, undaunted, make the sacrifice of our sons and daughters, laying their lives on the altar in wars that we might struggle to call as holy or just?
	- Final line is a quote from {{verse "Proverbs 3:17"}}
	- The hymn was reportedly a favorite of Princess Diana's
{{/if}}

2. How well do the text and tune fit together, and why?
{{#if notes}}
	- The meter for the text, 13.13.13D, is quite unusual, making it quite a coincidence that the "Jupiter" melody fit so easily
	- The melody is stately and compelling, not overly jubilant but not morose either: perfect for a serious hymn of devotion

1. Newton melds together a wide range of scriptural quotes and images to build up a picture of the New Jerusalem (Zion) as a metaphor for Christ's church. What references stick out to you, and what do they teach about the church?
{{#if notes}}
	- Verse 1 opens with a quote from {{verse "Psalm 87:3"}}
	- Verse 2 mixes images from {{verse "Exodus 17:1-7"}} with {{verse "Psalm 46:4"}} and {{verse "John 7:38"}}
	- Verse 3 uses two stories from Exodus {{verse "Exodus 13:21-22"}} (pillar of cloud/fire) and {{verse "Exodus 16:14-16"}} (manna); see also {{verse "Isaiah 4:5-6"}}
	- Verse 4 "kings and priests to God" is from {{verse "Revelation 1:6"}}
{{/if}}

2. How well do the text and tune fit together, and why?
{{#if notes}}
	- Interestingly, the 8.7.8.7D meter is the same as "Joyful, Joyful"
		- The meter basically necessitates use of a double rhyme (two syllables) for odd-numbered lines
	- Greater harmonic motion gives the tune a naturally slower tempo than the driving beat of "Ode to Joy"
		- Helps make the text more calm and ponderous, appropriate for an idyllic picture of peace and sustenance
	- This text and tune were first paired in 1889
		- Recently, alternative tunes (such as {{caps "Abbot's Leigh"}}) have been written to avoid the nationalistic associations with {{caps "Austria"}}
