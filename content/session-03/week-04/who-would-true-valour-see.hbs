Text: John Bunyan, 1684

Who would true Valour see,
Let him come hither;
One here will Constant be,
Come Wind, come Weather.
There’s no Discouragement
Shall make him once Relent
His first avow’d Intent
To be a Pilgrim.

Whoso beset him round
With dismal Storys,
Do but themselves confound;
His strength the more is.
No Lyon can him fright,
He’ll with a Gyant Fight,
But he will have a right
To be a Pilgrim.

Hobgoblin nor foul Fiend
Can daunt his Spirit:
He knows, he at the end
Shall Life Inherit.
Then Fancies fly away,
He’ll fear not what men say;
He’ll labor Night and Day
To be a Pilgrim.
